To translate the given Fortran code to C++, we need to understand the functionality of the original code and then implement similar behavior using C++ syntax and constructs. The Fortran code demonstrates dynamic storage allocation for an integer variable, increments it in parallel using OpenMP, and then prints the result. Here's how you can translate it to C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
    int* counter = new int; // Dynamic storage allocation

    *counter = 0; // Initialization

    #pragma omp parallel
    {
        #pragma omp atomic
        (*counter)++; // Increment in parallel
    }

    std::cout << *counter << std::endl; // Print the result

    delete counter; // Deallocate the memory

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Dynamic Storage Allocation**: In C++, dynamic memory allocation is done using `new` and deallocation using `delete`. We use `new int` to allocate memory for an integer.
2. **Initialization**: The integer is initialized to 0.
3. **Parallel Increment**: The `#pragma omp parallel` directive is used to parallelize the block. Inside the parallel block, `#pragma omp atomic` is used to ensure that the increment operation is atomic, which is necessary because multiple threads might access and modify `counter` concurrently.
4. **Printing the Result**: The value of `counter` is printed to the standard output.
5. **Deallocation**: The allocated memory is deallocated using `delete`.

### Notes:
- **OpenMP**: The `#pragma omp` directives are used to parallelize the code, similar to the `!$omp` directives in Fortran.
- **Atomic Operation**: The `#pragma omp atomic` directive ensures that the increment operation is atomic, which is necessary because multiple threads might access and modify `counter` concurrently.
- **Memory Management**: The `new` and `delete` operators are used for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, respectively.

This C++ code should exhibit similar functionality to the original Fortran code, demonstrating the use of dynamic storage allocation, parallel execution, and atomic operations in C++.
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
To verify the correctness of both the original Fortran code and the translated C++ code, we can create simple unit tests. These tests will check if the parallel execution correctly increments the counter.

### Fortran Unit Test

To test the Fortran code, we can modify the original program to include a simple test. Fortran doesn't have a built-in unit testing framework like some other languages, so we'll do a basic check.

```fortran
program DRB088_dynamic_storage_orig_yes
    use omp_lib
    implicit none
    integer, pointer :: counter
    integer :: expected_value

    allocate(counter)
    counter = 0

    !$omp parallel
    counter = counter+1
    !$omp end parallel

    expected_value = 1
    if (counter == expected_value) then
        print*, "Test passed."
    else
        print*, "Test failed."
    endif

    deallocate(counter)
end program
```

### C++ Unit Test

For C++, we can use a simple test framework like Google Test, but for simplicity, I'll provide a basic test similar to the Fortran example.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

bool test_increment() {
    int* counter = new int;
    *counter = 0;

    #pragma omp parallel
    {
        #pragma omp atomic
        (*counter)++;
    }

    bool result = (*counter == 1);
    delete counter;
    return result;
}

int main() {
    if (test_increment()) {
        std::cout << "Test passed." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Test failed." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

#### Fortran Test:
1. **Initialization**: The counter is allocated and set to 0.
2. **Parallel Execution**: The counter is incremented in parallel.
3. **Check Result**: The expected result is 1. If the counter equals 1, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.
4. **Cleanup**: The allocated memory is deallocated.

#### C++ Test:
1. **Initialization**: A new integer is allocated and set to 0.
2. **Parallel Execution**: The counter is incremented in parallel using atomic operations.
3. **Check Result**: The function `test_increment` returns `true` if the counter equals 1, indicating the test passed; otherwise, it fails.
4. **Main Function**: The main function calls `test_increment` and prints "Test passed." if the test succeeds, or "Test failed." if it fails.

### Running the Tests:

#### Fortran:
To compile and run the Fortran test, you can use a Fortran compiler like `gfortran`:

```sh
gfortran -fopenmp -o test_fortran test_fortran.f90
./test_fortran
```

#### C++:
To compile and run the C++ test, you can use a C++ compiler like `g++`:

```sh
g++ -fopenmp -o test_cpp test_cpp.cpp
./test_cpp
```

These tests should confirm that the parallel execution in both the Fortran and C++ versions correctly increments the counter.
