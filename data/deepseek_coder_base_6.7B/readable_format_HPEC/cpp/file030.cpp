To translate the given Fortran code to C++, we need to understand the structure and syntax differences between Fortran and C++. The Fortran code uses OpenMP for parallelism, which has a direct equivalent in C++ using OpenMP as well. Here's how the Fortran code can be translated to C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
    const int N = 64;
    int x[N], y[N];
    int a;

    // Initialize arrays
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        x[i] = 0;
        y[i] = 3;
    }

    a = 5;

    // OpenMP target directive equivalent in C++
    #pragma omp target map(to:y[0:N],a) map(tofrom:x[0:N]) device(0)
    {
        // OpenMP task directive equivalent in C++
        #pragma omp parallel for
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            #pragma omp task depend(inout:x[i])
            {
                x[i] = a * x[i];
            }

            #pragma omp task depend(inout:x[i])
            {
                x[i] = x[i] + y[i];
            }
        }
    }

    // Check results and print if necessary
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (x[i] != 3) {
            std::cout << x[i] << std::endl;
        }
    }

    // Wait for all tasks to complete
    #pragma omp taskwait

    return 0;
}
```

### Key Points:

1. **Array Indexing**: Fortran arrays are 1-based, while C++ arrays are 0-based. Adjustments are made accordingly.
2. **OpenMP Directives**: The `!$omp` directives in Fortran are replaced with `#pragma omp` in C++. The syntax and structure of these directives are very similar in both languages.
3. **Array Declaration and Initialization**: The array `x` and `y` are declared and initialized in a similar way in C++.
4. **OpenMP Target and Task Directives**: The `target` and `task` directives are used in a similar way in C++. Note that the syntax for array references in these directives has been adjusted to C++ syntax.
5. **Loop Constructs**: The `do` loop in Fortran is replaced with a `for` loop in C++.
6. **Printing**: The `print*,` statement in Fortran is replaced with `std::cout` in C++.

Make sure to compile the C++ code with OpenMP support enabled. For example, using `g++`, you would add the `-fopenmp` flag:

```sh
g++ -fopenmp your_program.cpp -o your_program
```
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
To verify the correctness of both the original Fortran code and the translated C++ code, we can write simple unit tests. These tests will check if the final values of the array `x` are as expected after the operations.

### Fortran Unit Test

For the Fortran code, we can write a simple test by modifying the program to include checks after the operations. Fortran doesn't have a built-in unit testing framework like some other languages, so we'll do a basic implementation.

```fortran
program DRB158_missingtaskbarrier_orig_gpu_no_test
    use omp_lib
    implicit none
    integer :: x(64), y(64), a, i, errors
    logical :: test_passed

    a = 5
    errors = 0
    test_passed = .true.

    ! Initialize arrays
    do i = 1, 64
        x(i) = 0
        y(i) = 3
    end do

    !$omp target map(to:y,a) map(tofrom:x) device(0)
    do i = 1, 64
        !$omp task depend(inout:x(i))
        x(i) = a*x(i)
        !$omp end task

        !$omp task depend(inout:x(i))
        x(i) = x(i)+y(i)
        !$omp end task
    end do
    !$omp end target

    !$omp taskwait

    ! Check results
    do i = 1, 64
        if (x(i) /= 3) then
            print*, "Test failed at index ", i, " with value ", x(i)
            errors = errors + 1
            test_passed = .false.
        end if
    end do

    if (test_passed) then
        print*, "All tests passed."
    else
        print*, errors, " tests failed."
    end if

end program
```

### C++ Unit Test

For the C++ code, we can use a simple testing approach similar to the Fortran example. C++ has more sophisticated testing frameworks available (like Google Test), but for simplicity, we'll stick to a basic implementation.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

bool test_function() {
    const int N = 64;
    int x[N], y[N];
    int a;
    bool test_passed = true;
    int errors = 0;

    a = 5;

    // Initialize arrays
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        x[i] = 0;
        y[i] = 3;
    }

    // OpenMP target directive equivalent in C++
    #pragma omp target map(to:y[0:N],a) map(tofrom:x[0:N]) device(0)
    {
        // OpenMP task directive equivalent in C++
        #pragma omp parallel for
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            #pragma omp task depend(inout:x[i])
            {
                x[i] = a * x[i];
            }

            #pragma omp task depend(inout:x[i])
            {
                x[i] = x[i] + y[i];
            }
        }
    }

    // Check results
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        if (x[i] != 3) {
            std::cout << "Test failed at index " << i << " with value " << x[i] << std::endl;
            errors++;
            test_passed = false;
        }
    }

    if (test_passed) {
        std::cout << "All tests passed." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << errors << " tests failed." << std::endl;
    }

    return test_passed;
}

int main() {
    if (test_function()) {
        return 0;
    } else {
        return 1;
    }
}
```

### Compilation and Execution

To compile and run the Fortran test, use:

```sh
gfortran -fopenmp your_fortran_test.f90 -o fortran_test
./fortran_test
```

To compile and run the C++ test, use:

```sh
g++ -fopenmp your_cpp_test.cpp -o cpp_test
./cpp_test
```

These tests will output the results of the tests to the console. If everything is correct, both tests should output "All tests passed."
