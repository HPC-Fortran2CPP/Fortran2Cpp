To translate the given Fortran code to C++, we need to understand the structure and functionality of the original code, and then implement similar functionality in C++. The Fortran code uses OpenMP for parallelism, specifically for tasking and threadprivate variables. The `module` and `program` constructs in Fortran are somewhat analogous to classes and main functions in C++.

Here's how the Fortran code could be translated to C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

// Equivalent to the Fortran module with threadprivate and subroutine
class DRB128 {
public:
    static int tp; // Making it static to mimic module-level variable
    static int var;

    // Equivalent to the Fortran subroutine
    static void foo() {
        #pragma omp task
        {
            tp = 1; // This will be executed as a task
        }
        #pragma omp taskwait // Wait for all tasks to complete
        var = tp; // This will be executed as another task
    }
};

// Static member initialization
int DRB128::tp = 0;
int DRB128::var = 0;

int main() {
    // Equivalent to the Fortran program
    #pragma omp parallel
    {
        DRB128::foo(); // Call the static method foo
    }

    std::cout << DRB128::var << std::endl; // Print the value of var

    return 0;
}
```

Key Points in the Translation:

1. **Module and Program Structure**: The Fortran `module` is translated to a C++ class. The `program` block is translated to the `main` function in C++.

2. **Threadprivate and Subroutine**: The Fortran `threadprivate` and `subroutine` constructs are translated to a static member variable and a static method in C++. The `threadprivate` attribute in Fortran ensures that `tp` is private to each thread, which is equivalent to making it `static` in C++.

3. **OpenMP Directives**: The OpenMP directives (`!$omp` in Fortran) are translated to C++ pragmas (`#pragma omp`). The `task` directive in Fortran is translated to a block enclosed by `#pragma omp task` in C++. The `taskwait` directive in Fortran is translated to `#pragma omp taskwait` in C++.

4. **Execution Model**: The OpenMP execution model is preserved in the translation. Tasks are created using `#pragma omp task` and executed concurrently. The `#pragma omp taskwait` ensures that all tasks are completed before moving on to the next line of code.

5. **Printing**: The Fortran `print*,var` statement is translated to `std::cout` in C++ for output.

6. **Parallel Region**: The `#pragma omp parallel` directive is used to create a parallel region, which is analogous to the `program` block in Fortran. This is necessary to enable parallel execution.

Remember, when compiling the C++ code with OpenMP support, you need to enable OpenMP in your compiler. For example, if you are using GCC, you would compile the code with the `-fopenmp` flag:

```sh
g++ -fopenmp your_program.cpp -o your_program
```

This will enable OpenMP support in your C++ program.
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
Creating unit tests for both the Fortran and C++ code involves checking the functionality of the `foo` subroutine/method and ensuring that the `var` variable is correctly updated. For simplicity, we'll focus on testing the functionality of `foo` and `var`, given the complexity of directly testing the OpenMP behavior (especially with tasks and threadprivate variables).

### Fortran Unit Test

Fortran doesn't have a built-in unit testing framework like some other languages, but we can write a simple test by modifying the program to check the expected values of `tp` and `var` after calling `foo`.

```fortran
module DRB128
    integer :: tp, var
    !$omp threadprivate(tp)
contains
    subroutine foo
        !$omp task
        tp = 1
        !$omp taskwait
        var = tp
        !$omp end task
        !$omp end task
    end subroutine
end module

program test_DRB128
    use omp_lib
    use DRB128
    implicit none

    call foo()

    ! Test if var is correctly updated
    if (var == 1) then
        print*, "Test passed: var is correctly updated."
    else
        print*, "Test failed: var is not correctly updated."
    end if
end program
```

To compile and run this Fortran test, use a command similar to:

```sh
gfortran -fopenmp test_DRB128.f90 -o test_DRB128
./test_DRB128
```

### C++ Unit Test

For C++, we can use a simple testing framework like Google Test. However, for simplicity, I'll show a basic example without an external framework.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

class DRB128 {
public:
    static int tp;
    static int var;

    static void foo() {
        #pragma omp task
        {
            tp = 1;
        }
        #pragma omp taskwait
        var = tp;
    }
};

int DRB128::tp = 0;
int DRB128::var = 0;

bool test_foo() {
    #pragma omp parallel
    {
        DRB128::foo();
    }

    return DRB128::var == 1;
}

int main() {
    if (test_foo()) {
        std::cout << "Test passed: var is correctly updated." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Test failed: var is not correctly updated." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

To compile and run this C++ test, use a command similar to:

```sh
g++ -fopenmp test_DRB128.cpp -o test_DRB128
./test_DRB128
```

### Note

These tests are quite basic and primarily check if `var` is correctly updated after calling `foo`. They don't cover the full complexity of OpenMP tasks and threadprivate variables, which might require more sophisticated testing strategies or mocking to fully validate the parallel execution model.
