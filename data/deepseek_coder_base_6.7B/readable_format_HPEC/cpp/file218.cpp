To translate the given Fortran code to C++, we need to consider several aspects, such as array indexing, I/O operations, and the loop constructs. In Fortran, arrays are 1-based, while in C++, they are 0-based. Also, the way arrays are declared and passed to functions differs. Here's a C++ version of the given Fortran subroutine:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

// Assuming DATA_TYPE is a basic type (e.g., int, float, double),
// and DATA_PRINTF_MODIFIER is a format specifier for that type.
// For simplicity, we'll use 'int' as DATA_TYPE and '%d' as DATA_PRINTF_MODIFIER.

void print_array(int n, int** path) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            std::cout << std::setw(4) << path[j][i]; // Adjusting for 0-based indexing
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
        if ((i * n + j) % 20 == 0) {
            std::cout << std::endl;
        }
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    int n = 10; // Example size
    // Dynamically allocate 2D array
    int** path = new int*[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        path[i] = new int[n];
        // Initialize with some values for demonstration
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            path[i][j] = (i * n) + j + 1;
        }
    }

    print_array(n, path);

    // Clean up dynamically allocated memory
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        delete[] path[i];
    }
    delete[] path;

    return 0;
}
```

Key Points:
- The `print_array` function takes a 2D array (`path`) and its size (`n`) as parameters.
- The array `path` is dynamically allocated in `main`, and initialized with some values for demonstration.
- The nested loops print the array elements, considering the 0-based indexing in C++.
- The `std::setw(4)` is used to format the output similar to the Fortran code, adjusting the width of each number to 4 characters.
- The `if` statement checks if the current element is the 20th element in a row or column, and inserts a newline if true.
- Memory cleanup is essential to avoid memory leaks.

This C++ code should behave similarly to the provided Fortran subroutine, printing the array elements with formatting and newline insertions as specified.
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
Below are examples of unit tests for both the Fortran and C++ versions of the code. These tests will verify the correctness of the array printing functionality.

### Fortran Unit Test

For the Fortran code, we'll write a simple program that calls the `print_array` subroutine and checks the output. Fortran doesn't have a built-in unit testing framework like some other languages, so we'll do a basic manual test.

```fortran
program test_print_array
    implicit none
    integer, parameter :: n = 10
    integer :: path(n, n)
    integer :: i, j

    ! Initialize the array
    do i = 1, n
        do j = 1, n
            path(j, i) = (i - 1) * n + j
        end do
    end do

    ! Call the subroutine
    call print_array(n, path)

end program test_print_array
```

This program initializes a 10x10 integer array and calls the `print_array` subroutine. You can manually verify the output to ensure it matches the expected format.

### C++ Unit Test

For C++, we can use a simple testing approach similar to the Fortran example, or we can use a more structured testing framework like Google Test. Here, I'll provide a basic manual test similar to the Fortran example.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>

void print_array(int n, int** path);

int main() {
    int n = 10; // Example size
    // Dynamically allocate 2D array
    int** path = new int*[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        path[i] = new int[n];
        // Initialize with some values for demonstration
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            path[i][j] = (i * n) + j + 1;
        }
    }

    // Capture the output
    std::ostringstream output;
    print_array(n, path);
    std::string result = output.str();

    // Expected output
    std::string expected = "";
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            expected += std::to_string((i - 1) * n + j) + " ";
        }
        expected += "
";
        if (i % 20 == 0) {
            expected += "
";
        }
    }
    expected += "
";

    // Check if the output matches the expected output
    if (result == expected) {
        std::cout << "Test passed!" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Test failed!" << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Expected:" << std::endl << expected << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Got:" << std::endl << result << std::endl;
    }

    // Clean up dynamically allocated memory
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        delete[] path[i];
    }
    delete[] path;

    return 0;
}

void print_array(int n, int** path) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            std::cout << std::setw(4) << path[j][i]; // Adjusting for 0-based indexing
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
        if ((i * n + j) % 20 == 0) {
            std::cout << std::endl;
        }
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}
```

This C++ program initializes a 10x10 integer array, calls the `print_array` function, captures its output as a string, and compares it to an expected string. If the output matches the expected output, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.

### Note

For a more thorough testing approach, especially for larger projects, consider using dedicated unit testing frameworks like Google Test for C++ or pFUnit for Fortran. These frameworks provide more flexibility and functionality for writing and managing tests.
