Certainly! Below is the translated C++ code from the provided Fortran code. Note that C++ does not have a direct equivalent of Fortran's `program`, but we can use a `main` function to represent the program. Also, C++ does not have a direct equivalent of Fortran's `use` statement for modules, but we can include the necessary headers and use the functions from the namespace or class.

Here is the translated C++ code:

```cpp
#include <omp.h>
#include "DRB083.h" // Assuming the original Fortran module is translated to this header file.

int main() {
    // OpenMP parallel region
    #pragma omp parallel
    {
        // Call the foo function
        foo();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Headers and Namespaces**:
   - `#include <omp.h>`: This is the header file that enables OpenMP in C++.
   - `#include "DRB083.h"`: Assuming the original Fortran module `DRB083` is translated to a C++ header file, we include it here.

2. **Main Function**:
   - `int main()`: This represents the main function of the C++ program.

3. **OpenMP Directives**:
   - `#pragma omp parallel`: This is the OpenMP parallel region.
   - `foo();`: This calls the `foo` function, which is assumed to be declared in the `DRB083.h` header file.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - `return 0;`: This indicates that the program has executed successfully.

Make sure that the `foo` function is declared and defined in the `DRB083.h` header file, and that the OpenMP library is correctly installed and configured in your development environment.
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
Below are the unit test codes for both the original Fortran code and the translated C++ code. These tests will verify that the `foo` function is called correctly within the OpenMP parallel region.

### Fortran Unit Test Code

First, let's create a Fortran module `DRB083` that contains the `foo` subroutine.

**DRB083.f90**:
```fortran
module DRB083
    implicit none
contains
    subroutine foo()
        print *, "foo called"
    end subroutine foo
end module DRB083
```

**DRB083_test.f90**:
```fortran
program DRB083_test
    use omp_lib
    use DRB083
    implicit none

    !$omp parallel
    call foo()
    !$omp end parallel
end program DRB083_test
```

To compile and run the Fortran code, you can use the following commands (assuming you have an OpenMP-capable Fortran compiler like `gfortran`):

```sh
gfortran -fopenmp DRB083.f90 DRB083_test.f90 -o DRB083_test
./DRB083_test
```

### C++ Unit Test Code

First, let's create a C++ header file `DRB083.h` that contains the `foo` function declaration.

**DRB083.h**:
```cpp
#ifndef DRB083_H
#define DRB083_H

void foo();

#endif // DRB083_H
```

**DRB083.cpp**:
```cpp
#include "DRB083.h"
#include <iostream>

void foo() {
    std::cout << "foo called" << std::endl;
}
```

**DRB083_test.cpp**:
```cpp
#include <omp.h>
#include "DRB083.h"

int main() {
    #pragma omp parallel
    {
        foo();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

To compile and run the C++ code, you can use the following commands (assuming you have an OpenMP-capable C++ compiler like `g++`):

```sh
g++ -fopenmp DRB083.cpp DRB083_test.cpp -o DRB083_test
./DRB083_test
```

### Expected Output

For both the Fortran and C++ programs, the expected output should be:

```
foo called
```

This output verifies that the `foo` function is called within the OpenMP parallel region. If the output is correct, it confirms that the translation from Fortran to C++ is correct.
