To translate the given Fortran code to C++, we need to consider several differences between the two languages, such as array indexing, memory management, and the way functions and pointers are handled. The Fortran code uses OpenMP for parallelism, which is not directly available in C++. However, we can mimic the behavior using OpenMP in C++ by including the appropriate headers and using OpenMP pragmas.

Here's a C++ version of the Fortran code, making use of OpenMP for parallelism:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

// Assuming the existence of a function foo that matches the signature in the Fortran code.
// This function is not provided in the original Fortran code snippet, so it's a placeholder.
void foo(int n, int* a, int* b, int* c, int* d) {
    // Placeholder for the actual implementation of foo
}

int main() {
    const int n = 1000;
    int* a = nullptr;
    int* b = nullptr;
    int* c = nullptr;
    int* d = nullptr;

    // Allocate memory for arrays a, b, c, and d
    a = new int[n];
    b = new int[n];
    c = new int[n];
    d = new int[n];

    // Call the function foo
    foo(n, a, b, c, d);

    // Nullify the pointers to deallocate the memory
    if (a != nullptr) {
        delete[] a;
        a = nullptr;
    }
    if (b != nullptr) {
        delete[] b;
        b = nullptr;
    }
    if (c != nullptr) {
        delete[] c;
        c = nullptr;
    }
    if (d != nullptr) {
        delete[] d;
        d = nullptr;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Key Points in the Translation:

1. **Memory Management**: In C++, dynamic memory allocation is handled using `new` and `delete[]`. This differs from Fortran's `allocate` and `deallocate`.

2. **Array Declaration and Allocation**: In C++, arrays are declared and allocated in a similar manner, but with `new[]` and `delete[]` for arrays.

3. **Function Calls**: The function `foo` is called with pointers to the allocated arrays. This requires a corresponding C++ function signature that matches the Fortran subroutine's interface.

4. **OpenMP**: The original Fortran code uses OpenMP for parallelism. In the C++ translation, OpenMP is included via the `<omp.h>` header and pragmas are used to parallelize sections of code. However, the provided `foo` function does not contain OpenMP directives, so the translation focuses on the memory management aspect.

5. **Pointer Nullification**: The Fortran code uses `nullify` to deallocate the arrays. In C++, this is done by checking if the pointers are not null and then deleting the allocated memory.

6. **Implicit None**: In Fortran, `implicit none` is used to avoid implicit typing based on variable names, which is the default behavior in C++.

Remember, when using OpenMP in C++, you need to compile the code with the appropriate flags to enable OpenMP support, typically `-fopenmp` for GCC and Clang, or `/openmp` for MSVC.
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
Creating unit tests for both the Fortran and C++ code involves writing additional code that will test the functionality of the original and translated code. For simplicity, let's assume that the `foo` function in both the Fortran and C++ code simply copies the elements from one array to another. This is a trivial operation for testing purposes.

### Fortran Unit Test

First, let's modify the original Fortran code to include a simple `foo` function that copies elements from one array to another.

```fortran
module DRB068
    implicit none
contains
    subroutine foo(n, a, b, c, d)
        integer, intent(in) :: n
        integer, intent(inout) :: a(n), b(n), c(n), d(n)
        integer :: i
        do i = 1, n
            b(i) = a(i)
            c(i) = a(i)
            d(i) = a(i)
        end do
    end subroutine foo
end module DRB068

program DRB068_restrictpointer2_orig_no
    use omp_lib
    use DRB068
    implicit none

    integer :: n = 1000
    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: a, b, c, d

    allocate (a(n))
    allocate (b(n))
    allocate (c(n))
    allocate (d(n))

    call foo(n,a,b,c,d)

    if(allocated(a))deallocate(a)
    if(allocated(b))deallocate(b)
    if(allocated(c))deallocate(c)
    if(allocated(d))deallocate(d)

end program
```

For unit testing, we can write a simple test in the same program that checks if `b`, `c`, and `d` contain the same values as `a` after the call to `foo`.

### C++ Unit Test

Similarly, let's modify the C++ code to include a simple `foo` function that copies elements from one array to another.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

void foo(int n, int* a, int* b, int* c, int* d) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        b[i] = a[i];
        c[i] = a[i];
        d[i] = a[i];
    }
}

int main() {
    const int n = 1000;
    int* a = nullptr;
    int* b = nullptr;
    int* c = nullptr;
    int* d = nullptr;

    a = new int[n];
    b = new int[n];
    c = new int[n];
    d = new int[n];

    // Initialize array a with some values for testing
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        a[i] = i;
    }

    foo(n, a, b, c, d);

    // Test if b, c, and d contain the same values as a
    bool testPassed = true;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (b[i] != a[i] || c[i] != a[i] || d[i] != a[i]) {
            testPassed = false;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (testPassed) {
        std::cout << "Test Passed" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Test Failed" << std::endl;
    }

    delete[] a;
    delete[] b;
    delete[] c;
    delete[] d;

    return 0;
}
```

In both cases, the unit test checks if the `foo` function correctly copies elements from `a` to `b`, `c`, and `d`. If the test passes, it prints "Test Passed"; otherwise, it prints "Test Failed".

Remember, to compile and run the Fortran code, you might use a command like `gfortran -fopenmp your_program.f90 -o your_program`, and for the C++ code, `g++ -fopenmp your_program.cpp -o your_program`, depending on your compiler and setup.
