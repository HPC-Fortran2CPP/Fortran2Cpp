To translate the given Fortran code to C++, we need to understand the structure and functionality of the original code, then implement similar functionality using C++ syntax and OpenMP directives. The Fortran code defines a module with a subroutine that uses OpenMP tasks and threadprivate variables. Here's how you can translate it to C++:

```cpp
#include <omp.h>
#include <iostream>

// Global variable to mimic the threadprivate variable in Fortran
int tp;

// Function prototype
void foo();

int main() {
    // Call the function equivalent to the Fortran subroutine
    foo();

    return 0;
}

// Translating the Fortran subroutine to a C++ function
void foo() {
    // OpenMP task region with tp set to 1
    #pragma omp task
    {
        tp = 1;
    }

    // OpenMP task region with tp set to 2
    #pragma omp task
    {
        tp = 2;
    }

    // Mimicking the behavior of the Fortran code where var can be 1 or 2
    // based on the value of tp
    int var = tp;

    // Printing the value of var to demonstrate its value can be 1 or 2
    std::cout << "var = " << var << std::endl;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Global Variable `tp`**: This variable is declared globally to mimic the `threadprivate` attribute in Fortran.
2. **Function `foo`**: This function contains OpenMP task regions that set the value of `tp` to 1 and 2, respectively.
3. **Main Function**: The `main` function calls the `foo` function to execute the translated code.

### OpenMP Directives:
- **`#pragma omp task`**: This directive is used to create a task that executes concurrently with the rest of the code.

### Notes:
- **Value of `var`**: The value of `var` can be 1 or 2, depending on which task finishes first. This is a bit tricky to replicate directly in Fortran because the original code does not specify the behavior of `var` when both tasks are finished. In C++, we can demonstrate the behavior by printing the value of `var`.
- **OpenMP Initialization**: Ensure that OpenMP is initialized in your C++ compiler. For example, if you are using GCC, you can initialize OpenMP by adding the `-fopenmp` flag to your compile command.

This translation aims to preserve the original code's structure and functionality using C++ syntax and OpenMP directives.
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
Creating unit tests for both the Fortran and C++ code involves checking the behavior of the `foo` subroutine/function and verifying the values of `tp` and `var`. However, the original Fortran code does not specify the behavior of `var` when both tasks are finished, making it challenging to write a direct unit test for `var`. Instead, I'll provide a simplified approach to testing the functionality of `tp` and `foo` in both languages.

### Fortran Unit Test

For Fortran, we can write a simple program that uses the module and calls the subroutine, then checks the value of `tp`. Since `var` is not directly testable in the provided code, we'll focus on testing `tp`.

```fortran
module DRB127
    integer :: tp, var
    !$omp threadprivate(tp)
contains
    subroutine foo
        !$omp task
        tp = 1
        !$omp end task
        !$omp task
        tp = 2
        !$omp end task
    end subroutine
end module

program test
    use omp_lib
    use DRB127
    implicit none

    call foo()

    ! Since var is not directly testable in the original code,
    ! we focus on testing tp.
    if (tp == 1 .or. tp == 2) then
        print *, "Test passed: tp is 1 or 2."
    else
        print *, "Test failed: tp is not 1 or 2."
    end if
end program
```

### C++ Unit Test

For C++, we can use a simple test framework like Google Test to verify the behavior of `foo` and `tp`. However, since `var` is not directly testable in the provided C++ code, we'll focus on testing `tp`.

First, you need to install Google Test in your environment. Then, you can write the following test code:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <omp.h>

// Assuming the translated C++ code is in a separate file or within a namespace
extern void foo(); // Declaration of the foo function
extern int tp; // Declaration of the global variable tp

TEST(DRB127Test, TestTP) {
    foo(); // Call the foo function to set tp

    // Since var is not directly testable in the original code,
    // we focus on testing tp.
    EXPECT_TRUE(tp == 1 || tp == 2);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
    return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

### Running the Tests

- **Fortran**: Compile the Fortran test program with OpenMP support and run it. Ensure your compiler supports OpenMP and that you enable it (e.g., `gfortran -fopenmp test.f90 -o test`).
- **C++**: Compile the C++ test code with Google Test and OpenMP support. Ensure you link against the Google Test library. The exact command depends on your setup, but it might look something like this: `g++ -fopenmp test.cpp -lgtest -lgtest_main -pthread -o test`. Then, run the executable.

These tests will verify that `tp` is set to 1 or 2 by the `foo` subroutine/function, ensuring the functionality is preserved across both languages.
