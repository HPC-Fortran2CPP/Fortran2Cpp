To translate the given Fortran code to C++, we need to consider several aspects, including the OpenMP directives, array handling, and data types. The Fortran code uses OpenMP for parallelism, which can be translated to C++ using OpenMP pragmas. The Fortran `real(dp)` type is equivalent to `double` in C++, and the `integer` types are translated to `int64_t` for 64-bit integers, which is the closest equivalent in C++ for Fortran's `integer(kind=8)`. Here's how the translation might look:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
    const int64_t len = 2560;
    double sum = 0.0;
    double sum2 = 0.0;
    std::vector<double> a(len), b(len);

    // Initialize arrays
    for (int64_t i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
        a[i] = static_cast<double>(i + 1) / 2.0;
        b[i] = static_cast<double>(i + 1) / 3.0;
    }

    // OpenMP target directives are not directly supported in C++, so we'll focus on the parallel regions.
    // Note: The original Fortran code uses 'target teams distribute' which is not directly translatable to C++ without additional context.
    // We'll simulate the parallel execution using OpenMP parallel for loops.

    // Simulating teams and distribute with OpenMP
    #pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:sum)
    for (int64_t i2 = 0; i2 < len; i2 += 256) {
        for (int64_t i = i2 + 1; i < std::min(i2 + 256, len); ++i) {
            sum += a[i] * b[i];
        }
    }

    // Parallel reduction for sum2
    #pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:sum2)
    for (int64_t i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
        sum2 += a[i] * b[i];
    }

    std::cout << "sum = " << static_cast<int64_t>(sum) << "; sum2 = " << static_cast<int64_t>(sum2) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Key Points:
- The `#pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:sum)` directive is used to parallelize the inner loop, similar to the Fortran version.
- The `#pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:sum2)` directive is used for the outer loop, which computes `sum2` in parallel.
- The `std::vector<double> a(len), b(len);` line declares two dynamic arrays `a` and `b` with `len` elements.
- The `for` loop initializations and conditions are directly translated from Fortran to C++.
- The `static_cast<double>(i + 1) / 2.0` and `static_cast<double>(i + 1) / 3.0` expressions convert the integer indices to doubles and perform the division operations as in the Fortran code.
- The `reduction` clause is used to safely accumulate the `sum` and `sum2` variables across threads.
- The `std::min` function is used to ensure that the loop does not go out of bounds when computing the last iteration of the loop.
- The `#include <omp.h>` directive is used to include the OpenMP library, which is necessary for OpenMP pragmas.

Please note that the original Fortran code's use of `target teams distribute` and `teams` constructs might require additional context or specific hardware to be fully translated to C++. The provided C++ code focuses on the parallel execution aspect, which is a common use case for OpenMP in C++.
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
Creating unit tests for both the Fortran and C++ versions of the code requires a framework or a testing method for each language. For Fortran, we can use a simple approach by comparing the output with expected values, as Fortran lacks a standardized unit testing framework akin to those available in C++. For C++, we can use the Google Test framework, which is widely used and supports a rich set of assertions.

### Fortran Unit Test

Since Fortran lacks a standardized unit testing framework, we'll write a simple test by comparing the output of the program to expected values. This is a basic approach and does not replace a proper unit testing framework.

```fortran
! test_drb097.f90
program test_drb097
    implicit none
    integer, parameter :: dp = kind(1.0d0)
    integer(kind=8) :: i, len
    real(dp) :: sum, sum2
    real(dp), dimension(:), allocatable :: a, b

    len = 2560
    sum = real(0.0,dp)
    sum2 = real(0.0,dp)

    allocate (a(len))
    allocate (b(len))

    do i = 1, len
        a(i) = real(i,dp)/real(2.0,dp)
        b(i) = real(i,dp)/real(3.0,dp)
    end do

    ! Your parallel code here, which should populate sum and sum2

    ! Expected values for sum and sum2
    ! These values are placeholders and should be calculated or known beforehand
    real(dp) :: expected_sum, expected_sum2
    expected_sum = 1234567890.0_dp  ! Example expected value
    expected_sum2 = 2345678901.0_dp  ! Example expected value

    if (abs(sum - expected_sum) > 1.0e-6_dp) then
        print *, "Test failed for sum"
    else
        print *, "Test passed for sum"
    end if

    if (abs(sum2 - expected_sum2) > 1.0e-6_dp) then
        print *, "Test failed for sum2"
    else
        print *, "Test passed for sum2"
    end if

    deallocate(a,b)
end program test_drb097
```

### C++ Unit Test with Google Test

First, ensure you have Google Test installed and set up in your project. The following example assumes you have a basic understanding of setting up Google Test in your environment.

```cpp
// test_drb097.cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <vector>
#include <omp.h>

// Assuming the parallel code is encapsulated in a function for testability
double compute_sum_and_sum2(const int64_t len, std::vector<double>& a, std::vector<double>& b) {
    double sum = 0.0;
    double sum2 = 0.0;

    // Simulating teams and distribute with OpenMP
    #pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:sum)
    for (int64_t i2 = 0; i2 < len; i2 += 256) {
        for (int64_t i = i2 + 1; i < std::min(i2 + 256, len); ++i) {
            sum += a[i] * b[i];
        }
    }

    // Parallel reduction for sum2
    #pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:sum2)
    for (int64_t i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
        sum2 += a[i] * b[i];
    }

    return sum + sum2;  // Returning sum + sum2 for simplicity, as it's a common practice to return multiple values in tests
}

TEST(DRB097Test, TestSumAndSum2) {
    const int64_t len = 2560;
    std::vector<double> a(len), b(len);

    // Initialize arrays
    for (int64_t i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
        a[i] = static_cast<double>(i + 1) / 2.0;
        b[i] = static_cast<double>(i + 1) / 3.0;
    }
