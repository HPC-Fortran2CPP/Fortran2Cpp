To translate the provided Fortran code to C++, we need to consider several differences between the two languages, such as array indexing, memory management, and parallel processing. The Fortran code uses OpenMP for parallel processing, which is a common practice in Fortran but not as straightforward in C++ as it is in some other languages. However, we can achieve similar functionality using OpenMP in C++.

Here is the translated C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <omp.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    int len = 100;
    std::vector<std::string> args;
    std::vector<int> a;

    // Process command line arguments
    if (argc > 1) {
        try {
            len = std::stoi(argv[1]);
        } catch (const std::exception&) {
            std::cerr << "Error, invalid integer value." << std::endl;
            return 1;
        }
    }

    // Allocate and initialize array 'a'
    a.resize(len);
    for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
        a[i] = i + 1; // Fortran arrays are 1-based, C++ arrays are 0-based
    }

    // Parallel processing
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
        int tmp = a[i] + (i + 1); // Adjust for 0-based indexing
        a[i] = tmp;
    }

    // Print the 50th element of the array 'a'
    std::cout << "a(50)=" << a[49] << std::endl; // 50th element is at index 49

    return 0;
}
```

Key Points:
- The `std::vector` is used to dynamically allocate arrays in C++, similar to Fortran's allocatable arrays.
- The `std::stoi` function is used to convert a string to an integer, handling the conversion error similarly to the Fortran code.
- OpenMP is used for parallel processing, with `#pragma omp parallel for` to parallelize the loop.
- C++ arrays are 0-based, so the 50th element is accessed at index 49.
- Error handling for invalid integer values in command line arguments is done using exceptions in C++, which is more idiomatic than the `iostat` approach in Fortran.
- Memory management in C++ is automatic and handled by the `std::vector`, so explicit deallocation is not needed.

Remember to compile this C++ code with OpenMP support enabled. For example, if you are using GCC, you can compile the code with the `-fopenmp` flag:

```sh
g++ -fopenmp your_program.cpp -o your_program
```
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
Creating unit tests for both the Fortran and C++ code involves writing additional code that will test the functionality of the original programs. For simplicity, we'll focus on testing the core functionality: the array initialization, parallel processing, and the handling of command line arguments (if any).

### Fortran Unit Test

For the Fortran code, we can write a simple test program that calls the main program with different command line arguments to verify the behavior. Fortran doesn't have a built-in unit testing framework, so we'll do this in a straightforward procedural manner.

```fortran
program test_DRB020
    implicit none
    integer :: i, test_len
    character(len=80) :: test_arg

    ! Test with no arguments
    call execute_command_line('DRB020_privatemissing_var_yes > test_output_noargs.txt')
    open(unit=10, file='test_output_noargs.txt', status='old', action='read')
    read(10, *)
    close(10)

    ! Test with a valid integer argument
    test_len = 50
    write(test_arg, '(i10)') test_len
    call execute_command_line('DRB020_privatemissing_var_yes ' // trim(test_arg) // ' > test_output_valid.txt')
    open(unit=10, file='test_output_valid.txt', status='old', action='read')
    read(10, *)
    close(10)

    ! Test with an invalid integer argument
    test_len = -1
    write(test_arg, '(i10)') test_len
    call execute_command_line('DRB020_privatemissing_var_yes ' // trim(test_arg) // ' > test_output_invalid.txt')
    open(unit=10, file='test_output_invalid.txt', status='old', action='read')
    read(10, *)
    close(10)

    print *, "Fortran tests completed."
end program test_DRB020
```

### C++ Unit Test

For C++, we can use a simple testing approach similar to the Fortran example. For a more sophisticated testing framework, consider using Google Test or Catch2.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>
#include <fstream>

void run_program(const std::string& args, const std::string& output_file) {
    std::string command = "./DRB020_privatemissing_var_yes " + args + " > " + output_file;
    std::system(command.c_str());
}

void test_no_args() {
    run_program("", "test_output_noargs.txt");
    // Add checks here to verify the output
}

void test_valid_arg() {
    run_program("50", "test_output_valid.txt");
    // Add checks here to verify the output
}

void test_invalid_arg() {
    run_program("-1", "test_output_invalid.txt");
    // Add checks here to verify the output
}

int main() {
    test_no_args();
    test_valid_arg();
    test_invalid_arg();

    std::cout << "C++ tests completed." << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Notes

- These tests are basic and assume the programs are compiled and linked correctly.
- For the Fortran tests, you might need to adjust the program to allow for testing, such as by adding print statements or by modifying the main program to accept command line arguments for testing purposes.
- For the C++ tests, you'll need to compile the C++ program with OpenMP support and adjust it to accept command line arguments for testing.
- These tests are designed to be run in a Unix-like environment.

Remember, the effectiveness of these tests depends on the programs' outputs being predictable and verifiable. The provided examples are simplified and assume a specific output format.
