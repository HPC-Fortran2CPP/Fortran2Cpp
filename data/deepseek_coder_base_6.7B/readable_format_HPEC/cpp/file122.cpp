Certainly! Below is the translated version of the provided Fortran code to C++. This translation assumes the use of OpenMP for parallelism and a similar structure to the original Fortran code. Note that C++ uses different syntax and conventions compared to Fortran, especially regarding array indexing and the way arrays are declared and used.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
    // Initialize the variable array
    std::vector<int> var(16, 0); // Equivalent to the Fortran array with 16 elements initialized to 0

    // OpenMP target directives for GPU offloading
    #pragma omp target map(tofrom:var[0:16]) device(0)
    {
        // OpenMP teams distribute parallel do
        #pragma omp teams distribute parallel for
        for (int i = 0; i < 20; ++i) {
            // OpenMP simd directive
            #pragma omp simd
            for (int j = 0; j < 16; ++j) {
                var[j] = var[j] + 1;
            }
        }
    }

    // Print the value of var[15] which corresponds to the Fortran index 16
    std::cout << var[15] << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Key points in the translation:

1. **Array Declaration and Initialization**: In C++, `std::vector` is used to create and initialize arrays dynamically. This is similar to the Fortran array but with dynamic sizing and built-in methods for array operations.

2. **OpenMP Directives**: The OpenMP directives in C++ are similar to Fortran, but the syntax and structure are adapted to C++. The `#pragma omp` directive is used in C++ for OpenMP directives.

3. **Loop Indices**: C++ uses 0-based indexing, so the loop indices start from 0 and go up to (but not including) the size of the array. This is adjusted in the translation.

4. **Printing**: The `std::cout` is used for output, similar to the `print*,` statement in Fortran.

5. **Array Access**: In C++, array elements are accessed using `[]` notation, with the index starting from 0. This is adjusted in the translation to match Fortran's 1-based indexing.

Remember to compile this C++ code with an OpenMP-capable compiler and enable GPU offloading if your system supports it. For example, using the `g++` compiler, you might compile the code with the following flags:

```sh
g++ -fopenmp -foffload=nvptx -o DRB163_simdmissinglock1_orig_gpu_no DRB163_simdmissinglock1_orig_gpu_no.cpp
```

This command assumes you're using the NVIDIA PTX (nvptx) offloading target, which is suitable for NVIDIA GPUs. Adjust the flags as necessary for your environment and compiler.
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
To verify the correctness of both the original Fortran code and the translated C++ code, we can create simple unit tests. These tests will check if the final state of the `var` array is as expected after the execution of the parallel sections.

### Fortran Unit Test

For the Fortran code, we'll modify the program to include a simple check after the parallel section to ensure the array `var` contains the expected values.

```fortran
program DRB163_simdmissinglock1_orig_gpu_no_test
    use omp_lib
    implicit none
    integer :: var(16), i, errors

    errors = 0

    ! Initialize var array
    do i = 1, 16
        var(i) = 0
    end do

    !$omp target map(tofrom:var) device(0)
    !$omp teams distribute parallel do
    do i = 1, 20
        !$omp simd
        do j = 1, 16
            var(j) = var(j) + 1
        end do
        !$omp end simd
    end do
    !$omp end teams distribute parallel do
    !$omp end target

    ! Check the final state of var
    do i = 1, 16
        if (var(i) /= 20) then
            print *, "Test failed for element: ", i, "Value: ", var(i)
            errors = errors + 1
        end if
    end do

    if (errors == 0) then
        print *, "All tests passed."
    else
        print *, "Number of failed tests: ", errors
    end if

end program DRB163_simdmissinglock1_orig_gpu_no_test
```

### C++ Unit Test

For the C++ code, we'll use a simple approach similar to the Fortran test, checking the final state of the `var` array after the parallel section.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> var(16, 0);
    int errors = 0;

    // OpenMP target directives for GPU offloading
    #pragma omp target map(tofrom:var[0:16]) device(0)
    {
        // OpenMP teams distribute parallel do
        #pragma omp teams distribute parallel for
        for (int i = 0; i < 20; ++i) {
            // OpenMP simd directive
            #pragma omp simd
            for (int j = 0; j < 16; ++j) {
                var[j] = var[j] + 1;
            }
        }
    }

    // Check the final state of var
    for (int i = 0; i < 16; ++i) {
        if (var[i] != 20) {
            std::cout << "Test failed for element: " << i << " Value: " << var[i] << std::endl;
            errors++;
        }
    }

    if (errors == 0) {
        std::cout << "All tests passed." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Number of failed tests: " << errors << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Compilation and Execution

To compile and run the Fortran test:

```sh
gfortran -fopenmp -o DRB163_simdmissinglock1_orig_gpu_no_test DRB163_simdmissinglock1_orig_gpu_no_test.f90
./DRB163_simdmissinglock1_orig_gpu_no_test
```

To compile and run the C++ test:

```sh
g++ -fopenmp -foffload=nvptx -o DRB163_simdmissinglock1_orig_gpu_no_test DRB163_simdmissinglock1_orig_gpu_no_test.cpp
./DRB163_simdmissinglock1_orig_gpu_no_test
```

These tests will verify that the final state of the `var` array in both the Fortran and C++ versions is as expected, ensuring that the translation has been done correctly and both implementations produce the same results.
