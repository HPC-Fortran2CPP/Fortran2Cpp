Certainly! Below is the translated version of the provided Fortran code into C++. This translation includes the OpenMP directives for parallel processing. Note that in C++, arrays are zero-indexed, unlike Fortran which is one-indexed. Also, the `std::vector` is used to dynamically allocate arrays, which is a more common and safer approach in C++ than raw pointers or arrays.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <omp.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    int len = 100;
    int x = 10;
    std::vector<std::string> args;
    std::vector<int> a;

    // Check if command line arguments are provided
    if (argc == 1) {
        std::cout << "No command line arguments provided." << std::endl;
    } else {
        // Attempt to convert the first argument to an integer
        try {
            len = std::stoi(argv[1]);
        } catch (const std::exception&) {
            std::cout << "Error, invalid integer value." << std::endl;
        }
    }

    // Allocate the arrays
    a.resize(len);
    args.assign(argv, argv + argc);

    // Parallel loop
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
        a[i] = x;
        x = i + 1; // Adjust for zero-based indexing
    }

    // Print the results
    std::cout << "x=" << x << " a(0)=" << a[0] << std::endl;

    // Deallocate the arrays (not necessary in this case since they are automatic in C++)
    // args.clear();
    // a.clear();

    return 0;
}
```

This C++ program mimics the behavior of the original Fortran code. It checks for command line arguments, converts the first argument to an integer (if provided), and then allocates two arrays (`args` and `a`) and fills `a` with `x` values, updating `x` along the way. Finally, it prints the values of `x` and `a[0]`.

Remember to compile this C++ code with OpenMP support enabled. For example, if you're using `g++`, you would compile the program like this:

```sh
g++ -fopenmp your_program.cpp -o your_program
```

This tells the compiler to enable OpenMP support.
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
Creating unit tests for both the Fortran and C++ code involves checking the functionality with different input values. However, the original programs do not take input from the command line, so for testing purposes, we'll modify both programs to accept a predefined length as input. This way, we can test with various lengths without needing command line arguments.

### Modified Fortran Program for Testing

```fortran
program DRB017_outputdep_var_yes
    use omp_lib
    implicit none

    integer :: len, i, x, ix
    integer, dimension (:), allocatable :: a

    ! Test length
    len = 100
    x = 10

    allocate (a(len))
    !$omp parallel do
    do i = 1, len
        a(i) = x
        x = i
    end do
    !$omp end parallel do

    print *, "x=", x, "a(0)=", a(0)

    deallocate(a)
end program
```

### Fortran Unit Test

To test this program, you can compile and run it with various lengths. Here's an example using a shell script:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Compile the Fortran program
gfortran -fopenmp DRB017_outputdep_var_yes.f90 -o DRB017_outputdep_var_yes

# Test with different lengths
for len in 10 20 50 100 200; do
    ./DRB017_outputdep_var_yes $len
done
```

### Modified C++ Program for Testing

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <omp.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    int len = 100; // Default length
    int x = 10;
    std::vector<int> a;

    if (argc > 1) {
        try {
            len = std::stoi(argv[1]);
        } catch (const std::exception&) {
            std::cerr << "Error, invalid integer value." << std::endl;
            return 1;
        }
    }

    a.resize(len);

    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
        a[i] = x;
        x = i + 1;
    }

    std::cout << "x=" << x << " a(0)=" << a[0] << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### C++ Unit Test

Similarly, you can use a shell script to test the C++ program with various lengths:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Compile the C++ program
g++ -fopenmp DRB017_outputdep_var_yes.cpp -o DRB017_outputdep_var_yes

# Test with different lengths
for len in 10 20 50 100 200; do
    ./DRB017_outputdep_var_yes $len
done
```

### Notes

- These scripts assume you have the necessary compilers (`gfortran` for Fortran and `g++` for C++) installed on your system.
- The Fortran program and the C++ program are modified to accept a length as an argument. This allows you to test them with various lengths without needing command line arguments.
- The unit tests simply run the programs with different lengths and print the results. You can add more sophisticated checks if needed.

By running these tests, you can verify that both the Fortran and C++ programs behave as expected for various input lengths.
