To translate the given Fortran code to C++, we need to consider several aspects, including the handling of arrays, function calls, and mathematical operations. The Fortran code uses a subroutine named `exact` that computes values based on the indices `i`, `j`, and `k`, and modifies an array `u000ijk`. The Fortran code also uses a module `lu_data`, which presumably contains the coefficients `ce` and possibly other parameters related to the computation.

Here's a C++ translation that attempts to preserve the logic and structure of the original Fortran code. Note that in C++, arrays are zero-indexed, unlike Fortran which is one-indexed. Also, we'll assume that the coefficients `ce` are accessible in a similar way or are passed as an argument to the function.

```cpp
#include <vector>

// Assuming lu_data is a struct or class that contains the coefficients `ce`
// and possibly other parameters related to the computation.
struct lu_data {
    // Example coefficients, replace with actual data
    std::vector<std::vector<double>> ce = {
        {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12},
        {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13},
        {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14},
        {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15},
        {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16}
    };
};

void exact(int i, int j, int k, std::vector<double>& u000ijk, const lu_data& data) {
    int nx0 = 10, ny0 = 10, nz = 10; // Example values, replace with actual values
    double xi = static_cast<double>(i - 1) / (nx0 - 1);
    double eta = static_cast<double>(j - 1) / (ny0 - 1);
    double zeta = static_cast<double>(k - 1) / (nz - 1);

    for (int m = 0; m < 5; ++m) {
        u000ijk[m] = data.ce[m][0]
                    + (data.ce[m][1]
                       + (data.ce[m][4]
                          + (data.ce[m][7]
                             + data.ce[m][10] * xi) * xi) * xi) * xi
                    + (data.ce[m][2]
                       + (data.ce[m][5]
                          + (data.ce[m][8]
                             + data.ce[m][11] * eta) * eta) * eta) * eta
                    + (data.ce[m][3]
                       + (data.ce[m][6]
                          + (data.ce[m][9]
                             + data.ce[m][12] * zeta) * zeta) * zeta) * zeta;
    }
}

int main() {
    int i = 1, j = 2, k = 3; // Example indices
    std::vector<double> u000ijk(5); // Initialize with size 5
    lu_data data; // Assuming lu_data is initialized elsewhere

    exact(i, j, k, u000ijk, data);

    // Do something with u000ijk
    return 0;
}
```

This C++ code attempts to closely follow the structure and logic of the original Fortran code. It uses a `struct` named `lu_data` to hold the coefficients `ce`, which is a common practice in C++ to encapsulate related data and functions. The `exact` function takes the indices `i`, `j`, and `k`, a reference to the `u000ijk` array, and a constant reference to an instance of `lu_data`. The `main` function demonstrates how to call `exact` with example indices and data.

Remember, this translation assumes that the coefficients `ce` are accessible in a similar way or are passed as an argument to the function. Adjust the `lu_data` structure and the way coefficients are accessed according to your actual data and implementation details.
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
To verify the correctness of both the original Fortran code and the translated C++ code, we can create simple unit tests. These tests will call the `exact` subroutine/function with predefined inputs and compare the outputs against expected results.

### Fortran Unit Test

First, let's create a Fortran program that tests the `exact` subroutine. We'll use a simple test case and print the results.

```fortran
program test_exact
    use lu_data
    implicit none

    integer :: i, j, k
    double precision :: u000ijk(5)

    ! Example test case
    i = 1
    j = 2
    k = 3

    call exact(i, j, k, u000ijk)

    print *, 'Test case: i=', i, 'j=', j, 'k=', k
    print *, 'Results:'
    print *, u000ijk

end program test_exact
```

This program sets up a test case and prints the results. You should replace the `print` statements with actual checks against expected values.

### C++ Unit Test

For the C++ version, we can use a simple test case and print the results. We'll use the `exact` function defined earlier.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath> // For fabs

// Include or copy the exact function and lu_data struct here

int main() {
    int i = 1, j = 2, k = 3; // Test case
    std::vector<double> u000ijk(5);
    lu_data data; // Assuming lu_data is initialized here

    exact(i, j, k, u000ijk, data);

    std::cout << "Test case: i=" << i << " j=" << j << " k=" << k << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Results:" << std::endl;
    for (size_t m = 0; m < u000ijk.size(); ++m) {
        std::cout << u000ijk[m] << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This C++ program does the same as the Fortran test program. It sets up a test case, calls the `exact` function, and prints the results.

### Verifying Correctness

To verify the correctness of both programs, you should compare their outputs against expected values for the given test case. For the sake of this example, let's assume the expected results are known and provided.

For the Fortran program, you would replace the `print` statements with actual checks against expected values, for example:

```fortran
    ! Expected results (placeholder)
    double precision :: expected(5) = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]

    print *, 'Test case: i=', i, 'j=', j, 'k=', k
    print *, 'Results:'
    print *, u000ijk

    ! Check results
    do m = 1, 5
        if (abs(u000ijk(m) - expected(m)) > 1e-6) then
            print *, 'Test failed at index', m
            stop
        endif
    end do
    print *, 'Test passed'
```

For the C++ program, you would replace the `print` statements with actual checks against expected values, for example:

```cpp
    // Expected results (placeholder)
    std
