To translate the given Fortran code to C++, we need to consider several differences between the two languages, such as array indexing, memory management, and parallel processing. Fortran arrays are 1-based, while C++ arrays are 0-based. Additionally, Fortran's `allocate` statement for dynamic arrays is somewhat different from C++'s `new` or `new[]` operator. Here's a C++ translation that attempts to preserve the original functionality:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
    const int n = 100;
    const int m = 100;

    // Dynamically allocate 2D array
    float** b = new float*[n];
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        b[i] = new float[m];
    }

    // Initialize array with some values (optional, for demonstration)
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for(int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
            b[i][j] = 0; // or some initial value
        }
    }

    // Parallel region
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i)
    for(int j = 1; j < n; ++j) { // Adjusted for 0-based indexing
        for(int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            b[i][j] = b[i][j-1];
        }
    }

    // Print a value for demonstration (adjust indices as necessary)
    std::cout << "b[49][49]=" << b[49][49] << std::endl; // 50th row/column in Fortran is 49th in C++ due to 0-based indexing

    // Deallocate memory
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        delete[] b[i];
    }
    delete[] b;

    return 0;
}
```

Key Points:
- The array `b` is dynamically allocated to have dimensions `n` by `m`.
- The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the outer loop, with `private(i)` specifying that `i` is private to each thread.
- The loop indices `i` and `j` start from 1 and 0, respectively, to maintain the original behavior of the Fortran code, considering C++ uses 0-based indexing.
- Memory is deallocated correctly to avoid memory leaks.
- This example assumes that the goal is to maintain the structure and functionality of the original Fortran code as closely as possible, including the parallel processing aspect.
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
Creating unit tests for both the Fortran and C++ code involves checking that the array manipulation and parallel processing logic produce the expected results. For simplicity, the tests will focus on verifying that the array `b` is correctly updated and that the parallel processing works as intended.

### Fortran Unit Test

Fortran lacks a built-in unit testing framework similar to what's available in other languages, so we'll create a simple test procedure within the program. This test will check the value of `b(50,50)` after the parallel loop to ensure it matches the expected outcome.

```fortran
program DRB014_outofbounds_orig_yes
    use omp_lib
    implicit none

    integer :: i, j, n, m
    real, dimension (:,:), allocatable :: b
    real :: expected_value

    n = 100
    m = 100
    expected_value = 0.0  ! Assuming the initial value is 0

    allocate (b(n,m))

    ! Initialize array with some values (optional, for demonstration)
    do i = 1, n
        do j = 1, m
            b(i,j) = expected_value
        end do
    end do

    !$omp parallel do private(i)
    do j = 2, n
        do i = 1, m
            b(i,j) = b(i-1,j)
        end do
    end do
    !$omp end parallel do

    ! Test: Check if b(50,50) is as expected
    if (b(50,50) == expected_value) then
        print*, "Test Passed: b(50,50)=", b(50,50)
    else
        print*, "Test Failed: b(50,50)=", b(50,50)
    endif

    deallocate(b)
end program
```

### C++ Unit Test

For C++, we can use a simple testing approach similar to the Fortran example. However, for more comprehensive testing, consider using a unit testing framework like Google Test. Here, we'll keep it simple for demonstration purposes.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

bool testArrayValue(float** b, int n, int m, float expectedValue) {
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for(int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
            if(b[i][j] != expectedValue) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    const int n = 100;
    const int m = 100;
    float expectedValue = 0.0f;  // Assuming the initial value is 0

    // Dynamically allocate 2D array
    float** b = new float*[n];
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        b[i] = new float[m];
    }

    // Initialize array with some values (optional, for demonstration)
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for(int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
            b[i][j] = expectedValue;
        }
    }

    // Parallel region
    #pragma omp parallel for private(i)
    for(int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
        for(int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            b[i][j] = b[i][j-1];
        }
    }

    // Test: Check if b[49][49] (50th row/column in C++) is as expected
    if (b[49][49] == expectedValue) {
        std::cout << "Test Passed: b[49][49]=" << b[49][49] << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Test Failed: b[49][49]=" << b[49][49] << std::endl;
    }

    // Deallocate memory
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        delete[] b[i];
    }
    delete[] b;

    return 0;
}
```

These tests are basic and assume that the initial value of `b` is `0` for all elements. You can adjust the `expectedValue` variable to match the actual initialization logic if needed. The tests check if the value at `b[49][49]` (or `b(50,50)` in Fortran) is as expected after the parallel processing, which should be `0` if the operation was successful.
