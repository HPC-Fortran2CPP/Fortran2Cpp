To translate the given Fortran code to C++, we need to understand the key components of the Fortran code and then find their equivalents in C++. The Fortran code defines a program that allocates two arrays (`newSxx` and `newSyy`) with a specified length (`len`) and then calls a function `foo` with these arrays and the length. It also demonstrates the use of OpenMP and a module (`DRB067`) by including the OpenMP library and using it.

Here is a C++ version of the Fortran code, assuming the equivalent functionality for the `foo` function is provided elsewhere. Note that C++ does not have a direct equivalent to Fortran's `allocate` and `nullify` for pointers, but we can use dynamic memory allocation and manual pointer management. Also, C++ does not have a direct equivalent to Fortran's `use` statement for modules, but we can include the necessary headers and use the namespace.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>
#include "DRB067.h" // Assuming this is the header file for the foo function

int main() {
    const int len = 1000;
    double* newSxx = new double[len];
    double* newSyy = new double[len];

    // Assuming foo is a function that takes pointers to the arrays and the length
    foo(newSxx, newSyy, len);

    // Manual deallocation of the allocated memory
    delete[] newSxx;
    delete[] newSyy;

    return 0;
}
```

Key Points:
- We use `new` and `delete[]` for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, respectively.
- The `kind(1.0d0)` in Fortran is equivalent to `double` in C++.
- The `use omp_lib` and `use DRB067` statements in Fortran are not directly translatable to C++. Instead, we include the OpenMP header (`#include <omp.h>`) and assume that the `foo` function is declared in a header file (`"DRB067.h"`).
- The `implicit none` statement in Fortran is not needed in C++ as variable types must be explicitly declared.
- The `program` and `end program` in Fortran are replaced by the `main` function in C++.
- The `associated` function in Fortran checks if a pointer is associated with a target. In C++, this is not necessary since we manage memory manually.
- The `nullify` statement in Fortran releases the association of a pointer with a target, making it not associated. In C++, we simply delete the pointer to release the memory.

Please note that this translation assumes that the `foo` function is defined elsewhere and is compatible with C++. If `foo` is a member function of a class or namespace, you would need to adjust the function signature accordingly.
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
Creating unit tests for both the Fortran and C++ code involves checking that the arrays `newSxx` and `newSyy` are correctly allocated, passed to the `foo` function, and then correctly deallocated. For simplicity, let's assume that `foo` simply fills the arrays with some predefined values, which we can then check.

### Fortran Unit Test

First, we need to modify the original Fortran code to include a simple implementation of the `foo` subroutine that fills the arrays with specific values for testing purposes.

```fortran
module DRB067
    implicit none
contains
    subroutine foo(newSxx, newSyy, len)
        integer, intent(in) :: len
        real(kind=8), dimension(len), intent(out) :: newSxx, newSyy
        integer :: i
        do i = 1, len
            newSxx(i) = i * 1.0d0
            newSyy(i) = i * 2.0d0
        end do
    end subroutine foo
end module DRB067

program DRB067_restrictpointer1_orig_no
    use omp_lib
    use DRB067
    implicit none

    integer :: len = 1000
    real(kind=8), dimension(:), pointer :: newSxx, newSyy

    allocate (newSxx(len))
    allocate (newSyy(len))

    call foo(newSxx, newSyy, len)

    ! Test to check if the arrays are filled correctly
    do i = 1, len
        if (newSxx(i) /= i * 1.0d0 .or. newSyy(i) /= i * 2.0d0) then
            print *, "Test failed at index: ", i
            stop
        endif
    end do
    print *, "All tests passed."

    if(associated(newSxx))nullify(newSxx)
    if(associated(newSyy))nullify(newSyy)
end program
```

### C++ Unit Test

Similarly, we'll modify the C++ code to include a simple implementation of the `foo` function that fills the arrays with specific values for testing purposes.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>
#include "DRB067.h"

void foo(double* newSxx, double* newSyy, int len) {
    for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
        newSxx[i] = (i + 1) * 1.0;
        newSyy[i] = (i + 1) * 2.0;
    }
}

int main() {
    const int len = 1000;
    double* newSxx = new double[len];
    double* newSyy = new double[len];

    foo(newSxx, newSyy, len);

    // Test to check if the arrays are filled correctly
    for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
        if (newSxx[i] != (i + 1) * 1.0 || newSyy[i] != (i + 1) * 2.0) {
            std::cout << "Test failed at index: " << i << std::endl;
            delete[] newSxx;
            delete[] newSyy;
            return 1;
        }
    }
    std::cout << "All tests passed." << std::endl;

    delete[] newSxx;
    delete[] newSyy;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- In both tests, we've added a simple implementation of the `foo` subroutine/function that fills the arrays with values based on their index (`i * 1.0d0` for `newSxx` and `i * 2.0d0` for `newSyy`).
- After calling `foo`, we iterate over the arrays to check if each element has the correct value. If any element does not match the expected value, the test fails and an error message is printed.
- If all elements are correct, a message indicating that all tests passed is printed.

These tests verify that the arrays are correctly allocated, passed to the `foo` function, and correctly deallocated, ensuring the translated C++ code behaves similarly to the original Fortran code.
