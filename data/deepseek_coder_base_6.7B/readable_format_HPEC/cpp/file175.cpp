To translate the given Fortran code to C++, we need to consider several aspects, such as array indexing, complex numbers, and the use of external functions. The Fortran code uses 1-based indexing, while C++ uses 0-based indexing. Moreover, Fortran's `double complex` type corresponds to `std::complex<double>` in C++. Here's a C++ version of the code, assuming the existence of equivalent functions for `ipow46` and `randlc` (which are not provided in the original code snippet, so they are assumed to be part of a library or external code):

```cpp
#include <complex>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

// Assuming these functions are defined elsewhere
extern void ipow46(double a, int n, double& an);
extern double randlc(double start, double an);

void compute_initial_conditions(std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<std::complex<double>>>>& u0, int d1, int d2, int d3) {
    int k, j;
    double x0, start, an, dummy;
    std::vector<double> starts(d3);

    start = seed; // Assuming seed is a global variable or passed as an argument
    ipow46(a, 0, an);
    dummy = randlc(start, an);
    ipow46(a, 2*nx*ny, an);

    starts[0] = start;
    for (k = 1; k < d3; ++k) {
        dummy = randlc(start, an);
        starts[k] = start;
    }

    for (k = 0; k < d3; ++k) {
        x0 = starts[k];
        for (j = 0; j < d2; ++j) {
            // Assuming vranlc is a function that takes parameters and modifies u0 accordingly
            vranlc(2*nx, x0, a, u0[0][j][k]);
        }
    }
}
```

This C++ code assumes that `ipow46` and `randlc` are functions that are defined elsewhere, and that `vranlc` is a function that modifies the `u0` array according to some logic, which is not provided in the original Fortran code snippet. You'll need to implement or link against the appropriate libraries or functions for these operations.

The key changes include:
- Using `std::vector` for dynamic arrays, which is a common and convenient way to handle arrays in C++.
- Using `std::complex<double>` for complex numbers.
- Adjusting array indexing to 0-based, as opposed to 1-based in Fortran.
- Including necessary headers and assuming external functions are defined elsewhere.

This translation assumes that the global variables `nx`, `ny`, `nz`, `a`, and `seed` are defined and accessible in the scope of this function, which might require passing them as additional parameters.
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
To verify the correctness of both the original Fortran code and its C++ translation, we can create simple unit tests. These tests will execute the functions/subroutines with predefined inputs and compare the outputs against expected results.

### Fortran Unit Test

For the Fortran code, we'll write a simple program that calls the `compute_initial_conditions` subroutine and checks the results. This example assumes that the subroutine and the external functions `ipow46`, `randlc`, and `vranlc` are correctly implemented.

```fortran
program test_compute_initial_conditions
    use ft_data
    implicit none

    integer, parameter :: d1 = 10, d2 = 10, d3 = 10
    double complex :: u0(d1+1, d2, d3)
    integer :: i, j, k

    ! Initialize global variables for the test
    nx = 5
    ny = 5
    nz = 5
    a = 1.0
    seed = 12345

    ! Call the subroutine
    call compute_initial_conditions(u0, d1, d2, d3)

    ! Check the results (example check, replace with actual checks)
    do k = 1, d3
        do j = 1, d2
            do i = 1, d1+1
                if (abs(u0(i, j, k)) > 1.0) then
                    print *, "Test failed at: ", i, j, k
                    stop
                endif
            end do
        end do
    end do

    print *, "All tests passed."
end program test_compute_initial_conditions
```

### C++ Unit Test

For the C++ code, we'll use a simple test case that initializes the necessary variables, calls the `compute_initial_conditions` function, and checks the results. This example assumes that the `compute_initial_conditions` function and the external functions `ipow46`, `randlc`, and `vranlc` are correctly implemented.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <complex>
#include <cmath>

// Assuming these functions are defined elsewhere
extern void ipow46(double a, int n, double& an);
extern double randlc(double start, double an);
extern void vranlc(int nx, double x0, double a, std::complex<double>& result);

void compute_initial_conditions(std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<std::complex<double>>>>& u0, int d1, int d2, int d3);

int main() {
    int d1 = 10, d2 = 10, d3 = 10;
    std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<std::complex<double>>>> u0(d1+1, std::vector<std::vector<std::complex<double>>>(d2, std::vector<std::complex<double>>(d3)));

    // Initialize global variables for the test
    int nx = 5, ny = 5, nz = 5;
    double a = 1.0, seed = 12345;

    // Call the function
    compute_initial_conditions(u0, d1, d2, d3);

    // Check the results (example check, replace with actual checks)
    for (int k = 0; k < d3; ++k) {
        for (int j = 0; j < d2; ++j) {
            for (int i = 0; i < d1+1; ++i) {
                if (std::abs(u0[i][j][k]) > 1.0) {
                    std::cout << "Test failed at: " << i << " " << j << " " << k << std::endl;
                    return 1;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    std::cout << "All tests passed." << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Notes

- These tests are quite basic and only check if the output arrays are within a certain range (in this case, `[-1, 1]`). You should replace these checks with more comprehensive tests that verify the correctness of the computations.
- The `ipow46` and `randlc` functions are assumed to be correctly implemented elsewhere. You should link against their implementations or provide mock versions for testing purposes.
- The `vranlc` function is also assumed to be correctly implemented. You might need to adjust its implementation or provide a mock version for testing.
- These tests assume that the global variables (`nx`, `ny`, `nz`, `a`, `seed`) are correctly set before calling the subroutine/function.

By running these tests, you can verify that both the Fortran and C++ implementations produce the same results for the same inputs.
