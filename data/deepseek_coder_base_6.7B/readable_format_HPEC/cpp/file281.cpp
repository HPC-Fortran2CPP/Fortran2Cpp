Certainly! Below is the translated C++ code from the provided Fortran code. Note that OpenMP directives in Fortran and C++ are similar, but the syntax and structure of the code will differ due to the differences in the languages.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

// Function declaration
void f1(int& i);

int main() {
    int i = 0;

    #pragma omp parallel
    {
        f1(i);
    }

    std::cout << "i = " << i << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

// Function definition
void f1(int& i) {
    #pragma omp atomic
    i = i + 1;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Declaration and Definition:**
   - The Fortran function `f1` is translated to a C++ function with the same name. The argument `i` is passed by reference to allow the function to modify the original variable.
   
2. **OpenMP Directives:**
   - The `!$omp parallel` directive in Fortran is translated to `#pragma omp parallel` in C++.
   - The `!$omp atomic` directive is used to ensure that the operation on `i` is atomic, which is similar to `#pragma omp atomic` in C++.

3. **Main Program:**
   - The main program in Fortran is translated to the `main` function in C++.
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0.
   - The `#pragma omp parallel` directive is used to parallelize the execution of the function `f1`.
   - The function `f1` is called inside the parallel region.
   - After the parallel region, the value of `i` is printed to the standard output.

This C++ code should behave similarly to the provided Fortran code, with the addition of OpenMP parallelization.
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
Below are the unit test codes for both the original Fortran code and the translated C++ code to verify the correctness of the translation.

### Fortran Unit Test Code

```fortran
program test_drb080_func_arg_orig_yes
    use omp_lib
    implicit none

    integer :: i
    integer :: num_threads

    i = 0
    num_threads = 4

    !$omp parallel num_threads(num_threads)
    call f1(i)
    !$omp end parallel

    print*, "i = ", i

contains

    subroutine f1(i)
        integer, intent(inout) :: i
        !$omp atomic
        i = i + 1
    end subroutine f1

end program test_drb080_func_arg_orig_yes
```

### C++ Unit Test Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

// Function declaration
void f1(int& i);

int main() {
    int i = 0;
    int num_threads = 4;

    #pragma omp parallel num_threads(num_threads)
    {
        f1(i);
    }

    std::cout << "i = " << i << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

// Function definition
void f1(int& i) {
    #pragma omp atomic
    i = i + 1;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Fortran Unit Test Code:**
   - The `program` block is used to define the main program.
   - The `use omp_lib` statement is used to include the OpenMP library.
   - The variable `i` is declared and initialized to 0.
   - The `num_threads` variable is used to specify the number of threads to use for parallel execution.
   - The `call f1(i)` statement calls the subroutine `f1` with the variable `i`.
   - The `print*` statement prints the value of `i`.
   - The `contains` section defines the subroutine `f1`.
   - The `subroutine f1` increments the value of `i` atomically using the `!$omp atomic` directive.

2. **C++ Unit Test Code:**
   - The `#include <iostream>` directive is used to include the standard input/output stream library.
   - The `#include <omp.h>` directive is used to include the OpenMP library.
   - The `main` function defines the main program.
   - The variable `i` is declared and initialized to 0.
   - The `num_threads` variable is used to specify the number of threads to use for parallel execution.
   - The `#pragma omp parallel num_threads(num_threads)` directive is used to parallelize the execution of the function `f1`.
   - The function `f1` is called inside the parallel region.
   - The `std::cout` statement prints the value of `i`.
   - The function `f1` increments the value of `i` atomically using the `#pragma omp atomic` directive.

### Running the Tests:

1. **Fortran:**
   - Save the Fortran code in a file, e.g., `test_drb080_func_arg_orig_yes.f90`.
   - Compile the Fortran code using a Fortran compiler that supports OpenMP, e.g., `gfortran`:
     ```sh
     gfortran -fopenmp test_drb080_func_arg_orig_yes.f90 -o test_drb080_func_arg_orig_yes
     ```
   - Run the compiled program:
     ```sh
     ./test_drb080_func_arg_orig_yes
     ```

2. **C++:**
   - Save the C++ code in a file, e.g., `test_drb080_func_arg_orig_yes.cpp`.
   - Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler that supports OpenMP, e.g., `g++`:
     ```sh
     g++ -fopenmp test_drb080_func_arg_orig_yes.cpp -o test_drb080_func_arg_orig_yes
     ```
   - Run the compiled program:
     ```sh
     ./test_drb080_func_arg_orig_yes
     ```

### Expected Output:

Both programs should output the value of `i` as 4, indicating that the increment operation was performed correctly in parallel. This confirms that the translation from Fortran to C++ is correct.
