To translate the given Fortran code to C++, we need to consider several aspects, including the syntax differences between Fortran and C++, the memory management, and the OpenMP directives. Here's a C++ version of the Fortran code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
    const int n = 180;
    const int dp = sizeof(double); // Assuming double precision
    std::vector<double> base(2025);
    std::vector<int> indexSet = {
        521, 523, 525, 527, 529, 531, 547, 549, 551, 553, 555, 557, 573, 575, 577, 579, 581, 583, 599,
        601, 603, 605, 607, 609, 625, 627, 629, 631, 633, 635, 651, 653, 655, 657, 659, 661, 859, 861, 863, 865, 867,
        869, 885, 887, 889, 891, 893, 895, 911, 913, 915, 917, 919, 921, 937, 939, 941, 943, 945, 947, 963, 965, 967,
        969, 971, 973, 989, 991, 993, 995, 997, 999, 1197, 1199, 1201, 1203, 1205, 1207, 1223, 1225, 1227, 1229, 1231,
        1233, 1249, 1251, 1253, 1255, 1257, 1259, 1275, 1277, 1279, 1281, 1283, 1285, 1301, 1303, 1305, 1307, 1309,
        1311, 1327, 1329, 1331, 1333, 1335, 1337, 1535, 1537, 1539, 1541, 1543, 1545, 1561, 1563, 1565, 1567, 1569,
        1571, 1587, 1589, 1591, 1593, 1595, 1597, 1613, 1615, 1617, 1619, 1621, 1623, 1639, 1641, 1643, 1645, 1647,
        1649, 1665, 1667, 1669, 1671, 1673, 1675, 1873, 1875, 1877, 1879, 1881, 1883, 1899, 1901, 1903, 1905, 1907,
        1909, 1925, 1927, 1929, 1931, 1933, 1935, 1951, 1953, 1955, 1957, 1959, 1961, 1977, 1979, 1981, 1983, 1985,
        1987, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013
    };

    // Initialize base array
    for (int i = 0; i < 2025; ++i) {
        base[i] = 0.5 * (i + 1); // Fortran arrays are 1-based
    }

    // Parallel region
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int idx1 = indexSet[i] - 1; // Adjust for 0-based indexing
        int idx2 = indexSet[i] + 11; // Adjust for 0-based indexing
        base[idx1] += 1.0;
        base[idx2] += 3.0;
    }

    // Print results
    std::cout << "xa1(999) = " << base[998] << " xa2(1285) = " << base[1284] << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Key points to note in the translation:

1. **Data Types and Constants**: The `kind(1.0d0)` in Fortran is replaced by `sizeof(double)` in C++ to get the size of a double precision floating-point number. This is a bit of a cheat since C++ doesn't have a direct equivalent of Fortran's kind system, but it's a reasonable approximation for this context.

2. **Arrays**: Fortran arrays are 1-based, while C++ arrays are 0-based. This difference is accounted for in the initialization of the `base` array and the indexing in the `indexSet` vector.

3. **Memory Management**: The Fortran code uses `allocate` and `pointer` to manage memory. In C++, `std::vector` is used for dynamic arrays, which automatically manages memory and provides a more modern and safer approach.

4. **OpenMP Directives**: The OpenMP directives (`!$omp parallel do` and `!$omp end parallel do`) in Fortran are translated to `#pragma omp parallel for` in C++. This tells the compiler to parallelize the loop using OpenMP.

5. **Printing**: The Fortran `print*` statement is replaced with `std::cout` in C++ for output.

6. **Program Structure**: The Fortran program structure is translated into a `main` function in C++, which is the standard entry point for C++ programs.

Remember to compile this C++ code with an OpenMP-capable compiler, such as `g++`, using the `-fopenmp` flag to enable OpenMP support:

```sh
g++ -fopenmp your_program.cpp -o your_program
```
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
Creating unit tests for both the Fortran and C++ versions of the code involves checking the final state of the `base` array after the parallel operations. For simplicity, we'll focus on a basic approach to testing, given the simplicity of the problem.

### Fortran Unit Test

Fortran doesn't have a built-in unit testing framework like some other languages, but we can write a simple test by comparing expected outcomes with actual outcomes.

```fortran
program test_DRB006_indirectaccess2_orig_yes
    use omp_lib
    implicit none
    integer :: i, idx1, idx2
    integer, parameter :: dp = kind(1.0d0)
    real(dp), dimension(2025), target :: base
    real(dp), dimension(:), pointer :: xa1=>NULL(), xa2=>NULL()
    integer, dimension(180) :: indexSet
    real(dp) :: expected_value

    allocate (xa1(2025
