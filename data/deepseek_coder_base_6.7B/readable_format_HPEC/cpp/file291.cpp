To translate the given Fortran code to C++, we need to consider several aspects, including array indexing, data types, and the loop structure. Fortran arrays are 1-based, while C++ arrays are 0-based. Also, the Fortran `do` loop is equivalent to C++ `for` loop. Here's how the Fortran code can be translated to C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>

// Assuming DATA_TYPE is a floating-point type (e.g., double)
using DATA_TYPE = double;

void kernel_seidel(int tsteps, int n, std::vector<std::vector<DATA_TYPE>>& a) {
    // The original Fortran code uses implicit none, which means all variables must be explicitly declared.
    // In C++, variables are typically declared at the point of first use.

    // The loop indices i, j, and t start from 1 in Fortran, but in C++, they start from 0.
    // We adjust the loop bounds accordingly.

    // The original Fortran code uses pragmas for scoping, which is not directly supported in C++.
    // However, we can ensure the loop is properly scoped by encapsulating it in a function or a block.
    // Here, we encapsulate it in a for loop for t.

    for (int t = 0; t < tsteps; ++t) {
        for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n - 1; ++j) {
                a[j][i] = (a[j - 1][i - 1] + a[j][i - 1] + a[j + 1][i - 1] +
                           a[j - 1][i] + a[j][i] + a[j + 1][i] +
                           a[j - 1][i + 1] + a[j][i + 1] + a[j + 1][i + 1]) / 9.0;
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int tsteps = 10; // Number of time steps
    int n = 100; // Dimension of the square matrix
    std::vector<std::vector<DATA_TYPE>> a(n, std::vector<DATA_TYPE>(n, 0.0)); // Initialize matrix with zeros

    // Fill the matrix 'a' with some values
    // ...

    kernel_seidel(tsteps, n, a);

    // Continue with the rest of the program
    // ...

    return 0;
}
```

Key Points:
- The `std::vector<std::vector<DATA_TYPE>>` is used to represent a 2D array dynamically. This is a common approach in C++ for representing matrices or arrays.
- The loop indices `i`, `j`, and `t` are adjusted to start from 0, as C++ uses 0-based indexing.
- The Fortran `implicit none` is not needed in C++, as all variables must be explicitly declared.
- The Fortran `DATA_TYPE` is assumed to be a floating-point type (e.g., `double`). You can change `DATA_TYPE` to any other floating-point type if needed.
- The original Fortran code uses OpenACC directives for parallelism, which are not directly supported in C++. However, the computation logic remains the same. If parallel execution is required, consider using libraries like OpenMP or CUDA for C++.
- The translation assumes that the matrix `a` is properly initialized and filled before calling `kernel_seidel`.
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
To verify the correctness of both the original Fortran code and the translated C++ code, we can create simple unit tests. These tests will initialize a matrix, apply the kernel function, and then check if the matrix has been updated correctly.

### Fortran Unit Test

First, let's create a Fortran program that includes the original subroutine and a test case.

```fortran
program test_seidel
    implicit none
    integer, parameter :: n = 100
    integer :: tsteps
    real(8), dimension(n, n) :: a
    integer :: i, j

    ! Initialize matrix with some values
    do i = 1, n
        do j = 1, n
            a(i, j) = 0.0
        end do
    end do
    ! Set a specific value for testing
    a(50, 50) = 10.0

    ! Set the number of time steps
    tsteps = 10

    ! Call the kernel subroutine
    call kernel_seidel(tsteps, n, a)

    ! Output the result for verification
    print *, 'Result at (50, 50):', a(50, 50)

contains

    subroutine kernel_seidel(tsteps, n, a)
        implicit none
        integer :: n, tsteps
        real(8), dimension(n, n) :: a
        integer :: i, t, j

        !$pragma scop
        do t = 1, tsteps
            do i = 2, n - 1
                do j = 2, n - 1
                    a(j, i) = (a(j - 1, i - 1) + a(j, i - 1) + a(j + 1, i - 1) + &
                               a(j - 1, i) + a(j, i) + a(j + 1, i) + &
                               a(j - 1, i + 1) + a(j, i + 1) + a(j + 1, i + 1)) / 9.0D0
                end do
            end do
        end do
        !$pragma endscop
    end subroutine kernel_seidel

end program test_seidel
```

### C++ Unit Test

Now, let's create a C++ program that includes the translated function and a test case.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath> // For fabs

using DATA_TYPE = double;

void kernel_seidel(int tsteps, int n, std::vector<std::vector<DATA_TYPE>>& a) {
    for (int t = 0; t < tsteps; ++t) {
        for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n - 1; ++j) {
                a[j][i] = (a[j - 1][i - 1] + a[j][i - 1] + a[j + 1][i - 1] +
                           a[j - 1][i] + a[j][i] + a[j + 1][i] +
                           a[j - 1][i + 1] + a[j][i + 1] + a[j + 1][i + 1]) / 9.0;
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    const int n = 100;
    int tsteps = 10;
    std::vector<std::vector<DATA_TYPE>> a(n, std::vector<DATA_TYPE>(n, 0.0));

    // Set a specific value for testing
    a[49][49] = 10.0; // Adjusted for 0-based indexing

    kernel_seidel(tsteps, n, a);

    // Output the result for verification
    std::cout << "Result at (50, 50): " << a[49][49] << std::endl; // Adjusted for 0-based indexing

    return 0;
}
```

### Verification

To verify the correctness of both programs, you should run them and compare the output. For the given test case, both programs should output a value close to `10.0` after the specified number of time steps. This value should be the same for both programs, indicating that the translation was successful.

### Note

- The Fortran program uses `real(8)` for double precision, which is equivalent to `double` in C++.
- The C++ program uses `std::vector<std::vector<DATA_TYPE>>` for the matrix, where `DATA_TYPE` is `double`.
- The indices in the output statement have been adjusted to match the 1-based indexing of Fortran and the 0-based indexing of C++.
- Ensure that
