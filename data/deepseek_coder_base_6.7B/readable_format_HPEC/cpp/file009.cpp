Certainly! Below is the translated version of the provided Fortran code to C++. This translation includes OpenMP directives for SIMD parallelism, similar to the Fortran code. Note that C++ uses zero-based indexing, unlike Fortran's one-based indexing.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
    int m = 2;
    int n = 4;
    float b[4]; // Assuming the size is 4 as in the Fortran code

    // Initialize the array b
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        b[i] = static_cast<float>(i); // Example initialization
    }

    // OpenMP SIMD directive with safelen(2)
    #pragma omp simd safelen(2)
    for (int i = m; i < n; ++i) {
        b[i] = b[i - m] - 1.0f;
    }

    // Print the value of b[2] (Fortran arrays are 1-based, C++ arrays are 0-based)
    std::cout << b[2] << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Key points in the translation:
- The `#include <omp.h>` directive is used to include the OpenMP library.
- The `#pragma omp simd safelen(2)` directive is used to parallelize the loop with SIMD parallelism, similar to the `!$omp simd safelen(2)` in Fortran.
- C++ uses zero-based indexing, so when accessing array elements, `b[2]` corresponds to the third element in the array, as opposed to Fortran's `b(3)`.
- The loop index `i` starts from `m` (`m = 2`) in C++, which is consistent with the Fortran code's logic.
- The `static_cast<float>(i)` initialization is just an example; you can initialize the array `b` as needed.
- The `std::cout` is used for printing, similar to the `print*,` statement in Fortran.

Remember to compile this C++ code with an OpenMP-capable compiler and enable OpenMP support. For example, using `g++`, you would compile the code with the `-fopenmp` flag:

```sh
g++ -fopenmp your_program.cpp -o your_program
```
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
Below are simple unit test examples for both the original Fortran code and the translated C++ code. These tests will verify the correctness of the operations performed by the code.

### Fortran Unit Test

For the Fortran code, we'll create a simple test program that checks if the array `b` is modified correctly.

```fortran
program test_DRB137_simdsafelen_orig_no
    use omp_lib
    implicit none

    integer :: i, m, n
    real :: b(4)
    real :: expected_b(4)
    logical :: test_passed

    m = 2
    n = 4

    ! Initialize the array b with some values
    do i = 1, n
        b(i) = real(i)
    end do

    ! Expected values after the operation
    expected_b(1) = 1.0
    expected_b(2) = 2.0
    expected_b(3) = 3.0
    expected_b(4) = 4.0

    !$omp simd safelen(2)
    do i = m+1, n
        b(i) = b(i-m) - 1.0
    end do

    ! Check if the operation was performed correctly
    test_passed = .true.
    do i = 1, n
        if (b(i) /= expected_b(i)) then
            test_passed = .false.
            exit
        endif
    end do

    if (test_passed) then
        print*, "Test passed."
    else
        print*, "Test failed."
    endif

end program test_DRB137_simdsafelen_orig_no
```

### C++ Unit Test

For the C++ code, we'll use a simple test function that checks if the array `b` is modified correctly.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>
#include <cmath> // For fabs()

bool test_simd_operation() {
    int m = 2;
    int n = 4;
    float b[4];
    float expected_b[4] = {1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f};

    // Initialize the array b
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        b[i] = static_cast<float>(i + 1); // Example initialization
    }

    // OpenMP SIMD directive with safelen(2)
    #pragma omp simd safelen(2)
    for (int i = m; i < n; ++i) {
        b[i] = b[i - m] - 1.0f;
    }

    // Check if the operation was performed correctly
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (std::fabs(b[i] - expected_b[i]) > 1e-5) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    if (test_simd_operation()) {
        std::cout << "Test passed." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Test failed." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Compilation and Execution

- **For Fortran**: Use a Fortran compiler like `gfortran`. Compile and run the test program:
  ```sh
  gfortran -fopenmp test_DRB137_simdsafelen_orig_no.f90 -o test_DRB137
  ./test_DRB137
  ```

- **For C++**: Use a C++ compiler like `g++`. Compile and run the test program:
  ```sh
  g++ -fopenmp test_simd_operation.cpp -o test_simd_operation
  ./test_simd_operation
  ```

These tests should verify that the operations performed by both the original Fortran code and the translated C++ code are consistent with each other.
