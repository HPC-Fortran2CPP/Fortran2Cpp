To translate the given Fortran code to C++, we need to understand the structure and the functionality of the original code and then implement similar behavior using C++ syntax and OpenMP directives. The Fortran code uses OpenMP for parallelism and demonstrates critical sections, atomic operations, and thread synchronization.

Here's a C++ translation that captures the essence of the original Fortran code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
    int x = 0;
    int y = 0;
    int tmp;

    #pragma omp parallel num_threads(2) private(tmp)
    {
        int thrd = omp_get_thread_num();

        if (thrd == 0) {
            #pragma omp critical
            {
                x = 10;
            }

            #pragma omp flush(x)

            #pragma omp atomic write
            y = 1;
        } else {
            tmp = 0;
            while (tmp == 0) {
                #pragma omp atomic read acquire // or seq_cst
                tmp = x;
            }

            #pragma omp critical
            {
                std::cout << "x = " << x << std::endl;
            }
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Key Points of Translation:

1. **Program Structure**: The `program` block in Fortran is translated to the `main` function in C++.

2. **Module and Use Statement**: The `use omp_lib` statement in Fortran is equivalent to including the OpenMP header in C++ (`#include <omp.h>`).

3. **Implicit None**: In Fortran, `implicit none` is used to avoid implicit typing based on variable names, which is the default behavior in C++.

4. **Variable Declarations**: Variables are declared at the beginning of the program, similar to their declaration in Fortran. In C++, variable types must be explicitly stated.

5. **OpenMP Directives**: The OpenMP directives (`!$omp` in Fortran) are translated to `#pragma omp` in C++. The syntax and usage are preserved as much as possible, although there might be slight differences in how OpenMP is implemented in different compilers.

6. **Printing**: Fortran's `print *` is replaced with C++'s `std::cout`.

7. **Atomic Operations**: The `!$omp atomic` directive in Fortran is translated to `#pragma omp atomic` in C++. The `read` and `write` clauses are directly translated to their C++ equivalents.

8. **Synchronization Constructs**: The `critical` and `flush` directives are translated to `#pragma omp critical` and `#pragma omp flush`, respectively.

9. **Thread Numbers**: The `omp_get_thread_num` function is used to get the thread number, similar to its usage in Fortran.

10. **Loops and Conditionals**: The structure of loops and conditionals (`if`, `else`, `do while`) is preserved as much as possible, with syntax adjustments for C++.

This translation aims to maintain the original program's logic and functionality while adapting it to C++ syntax and OpenMP conventions.
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
Creating executable unit tests for both the original Fortran code and the translated C++ code involves checking the correctness of the critical section and atomic operations. However, due to the nature of parallel execution and the potential for race conditions, the tests are designed to be somewhat abstract and focus on the functionality rather than the exact outcomes.

### Fortran Unit Test

For the Fortran code, we'll create a simple test that checks if the critical section and atomic operations work as expected. This test will be somewhat artificial since the original code's logic is more about demonstrating parallel execution and synchronization than it is about calculating a specific result.

```fortran
program test_DRB142_acquirerelease_orig_yes
    use omp_lib
    implicit none

    integer :: x, y, thrd
    integer :: tmp
    logical :: test_passed
    x = 0
    y = 0
    test_passed = .true.

    !$omp parallel num_threads(2) private(thrd, tmp)
        thrd = omp_get_thread_num()
        if (thrd == 0) then
            !$omp critical
            x = 10
            !$omp end critical

            !$omp flush(x)

            !$omp atomic write
            y = 1
            !$omp end atomic
        else
            tmp = 0
            do while(tmp == 0)
                !$omp atomic read acquire ! or seq_cst
                tmp = x
                !$omp end atomic
            end do
            !$omp critical
            if (x /= 10) then
                print *, "Test failed: x is not 10"
                test_passed = .false.
            end if
            if (y /= 1) then
                print *, "Test failed: y is not 1"
                test_passed = .false.
            end if
            !$omp end critical
        end if
    !$omp end parallel

    if (test_passed) then
        print *, "All tests passed."
    end if
end program test_DRB142_acquirerelease_orig_yes
```

### C++ Unit Test

For the C++ code, we'll use a similar approach to verify the critical section and atomic operations. This test will also be somewhat abstract due to the nature of the original code.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>
#include <cassert>

int main() {
    int x = 0;
    int y = 0;
    int tmp;
    bool test_passed = true;

    #pragma omp parallel num_threads(2) private(tmp)
    {
        int thrd = omp_get_thread_num();

        if (thrd == 0) {
            #pragma omp critical
            {
                x = 10;
            }

            #pragma omp flush(x)

            #pragma omp atomic write
            y = 1;
        } else {
            tmp = 0;
            while (tmp == 0) {
                #pragma omp atomic read acquire // or seq_cst
                tmp = x;
            }

            #pragma omp critical
            {
                if (x != 10) {
                    std::cerr << "Test failed: x is not 10" << std::endl;
                    test_passed = false;
                }
                if (y != 1) {
                    std::cerr << "Test failed: y is not 1" << std::endl;
                    test_passed = false;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    if (test_passed) {
        std::cout << "All tests passed." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Running the Tests

To run these tests, you'll need a Fortran and a C++ compiler that supports OpenMP. For Fortran, you might use a compiler like `gfortran`, and for C++, `g++` or `clang++` with OpenMP support.

- For Fortran:
  ```sh
  gfortran -fopenmp test_DRB142_acquirerelease_orig_yes.f90 -o test_DRB142
  ./test_DRB142
  ```

- For C++:
  ```sh
  g++ -fopenmp test_DRB142_acquirerelease_orig_yes.cpp -o test_DRB142
  ./test_DRB142
  ```

These tests are basic and primarily check if the critical sections and atomic operations are correctly implemented. They do not verify the correctness of the parallel execution or the synchronization mechanisms, which are more complex and depend on the specific behavior of the hardware and the compiler's implementation of OpenMP.
