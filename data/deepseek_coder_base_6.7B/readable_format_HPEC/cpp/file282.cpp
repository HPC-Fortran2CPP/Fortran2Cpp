To translate the given Fortran code to C++, we need to consider several aspects, including the OpenMP directives, function calls, and variable declarations. The Fortran code uses OpenMP for parallelization, which has a direct counterpart in C++ with the `#pragma` directive. The `use` statements in Fortran are similar to `#include` directives in C++. The `implicit none` statement in Fortran is not needed in C++ as variable types must be explicitly declared.

Here's the translated C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

// Assuming the declaration of foo is available here
extern void foo(long i);

long sum = 0;
long sum1 = 0;

int main() {
    #pragma omp parallel
    {
        #pragma omp for
        for (long i = 1; i <= 1001; ++i) {
            foo(i);
        }

        #pragma omp critical
        {
            sum += sum;
        }
    }

    for (long i = 1; i <= 1001; ++i) {
        sum1 += i;
    }

    std::cout << "sum = " << sum << " sum1 = " << sum1 << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Key Points:
- The `#pragma omp parallel` directive is used to parallelize the loop and the critical section.
- The `#pragma omp for` directive is used to parallelize the loop.
- The `#pragma omp critical` directive is used to ensure mutual exclusion for the critical section.
- The `extern void foo(long i);` line assumes that the function `foo` is declared elsewhere, similar to how the Fortran code uses the `use` statement.
- Variables `sum` and `sum1` are declared as `long` to match the `integer (kind=8)` declaration in Fortran.
- The `std::cout` is used for printing, similar to the `print*` statement in Fortran.

Make sure to compile this C++ code with OpenMP support enabled. For example, if you are using GCC, you can compile the code with the `-fopenmp` flag:

```sh
g++ -fopenmp -o program program.cpp
```
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
Creating unit tests for both the Fortran and C++ code involves testing the functionality of the `foo` function and verifying the final results of `sum` and `sum1`. However, since the original `foo` function's implementation is not provided, I'll create a simplified version of `foo` for demonstration purposes. Let's assume `foo` simply increments its input by 1, which is a trivial operation but sufficient for demonstrating the unit test.

### Fortran Version

First, let's adjust the Fortran code to include a simple `foo` function.

```fortran
module DRB084
    implicit none
contains
    subroutine foo(i)
        integer(kind=8), intent(in) :: i
        ! This is a simplified version of foo for demonstration.
        ! In a real scenario, foo would perform some operations.
        sum0 = sum0 + i
    end subroutine foo
end module DRB084

program DRB084_threadprivatemissing_orig_yes
    use omp_lib
    use DRB084
    implicit none

    integer(kind=8) :: i, sum
    sum = 0

    !$omp parallel
        !$omp do
            do i = 1, 1001
                call foo(i)
            end do
        !$omp end do
        !$omp critical
            sum = sum + sum0
        !$omp end critical
    !$omp end parallel

    do i = 1, 1001
        sum1 = sum1 + i
    end do

    print*, 'sum = ', sum, 'sum1 =', sum1
end program
```

### Fortran Unit Test

For the Fortran code, we can write a simple test by adding a check after the main program block.

```fortran
! Add this at the end of the Fortran program
if (sum == 500500 .and. sum1 == 500500) then
    print*, 'Test passed.'
else
    print*, 'Test failed.'
end if
```

### C++ Version

Now, let's adjust the C++ code similarly.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

long sum = 0;
long sum1 = 0;

void foo(long i) {
    // This is a simplified version of foo for demonstration.
    // In a real scenario, foo would perform some operations.
    sum += i;
}

int main() {
    #pragma omp parallel
    {
        #pragma omp for
        for (long i = 1; i <= 1001; ++i) {
            foo(i);
        }

        #pragma omp critical
        {
            sum += sum;
        }
    }

    for (long i = 1; i <= 1001; ++i) {
        sum1 += i;
    }

    std::cout << "sum = " << sum << " sum1 = " << sum1 << std::endl;

    // Unit test
    if (sum == 500500 && sum1 == 500500) {
        std::cout << "Test passed." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Test failed." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Compilation and Execution

For both Fortran and C++, you need to compile with OpenMP support. For Fortran, use:

```sh
gfortran -fopenmp -o program program.f90
./program
```

For C++, use:

```sh
g++ -fopenmp -o program program.cpp
./program
```

These tests are basic and assume that the `foo` function simply increments `sum` by the input value. In a real scenario, `foo` would perform more complex operations, and the test should reflect those operations.
