To translate the given Fortran code to C++, we need to consider several aspects, including the syntax differences between Fortran and C++, the OpenMP directives, and the handling of arrays (which in Fortran are dynamically allocated and can have their dimensions passed at runtime, while in C++, we typically use static or dynamic arrays or containers from the Standard Template Library (STL)). Here's a C++ version of the Fortran code using OpenMP for parallelization:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <omp.h>

// Function prototype
void foo();

int main() {
    // Call the function
    foo();
    return 0;
}

void foo() {
    const int len = 100;
    std::vector<std::vector<float>> b(len, std::vector<float>(len));
    int n = len;
    int m = len;

    // OpenMP parallel loop
    #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(j)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m - 1; ++j) {
            b[i][j] = b[i][j + 1];
        }
    }
}
```

Key points in the translation:

1. **Array Representation**: In C++, we use `std::vector` to represent a 2D array dynamically. This choice simplifies memory management and array operations compared to raw pointers or fixed-size arrays.

2. **OpenMP Directives**: The OpenMP directives (`#pragma omp parallel for`) are used similarly to Fortran, but the syntax is adapted to C++. The `collapse(2)` directive is used to collapse the nested loops into a single parallel loop, which is more efficient for OpenMP parallel execution.

3. **Indexing**: Fortran arrays are 1-based, while C++ arrays (or vectors) are 0-based. This translation maintains the original logic, but note that the loop indices start from 0 in C++.

4. **Function Definition**: The subroutine `foo` is translated into a void function in C++, as it does not return a value.

5. **Main Program**: The `main` function serves as the entry point for C++ programs, equivalent to the `program` block in Fortran.

6. **Headers and Namespaces**: The `#include` directives include necessary headers for input/output operations and for using the OpenMP library. The `std` namespace is used to access the Standard Template Library (STL) functionalities.

Remember to compile this C++ code with an OpenMP-capable compiler and enable OpenMP support (e.g., by using the `-fopenmp` flag with GCC or Clang).
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
Below are simple unit tests for both the original Fortran code and the translated C++ code. These tests will verify the correctness of the array manipulation logic in both implementations.

### Fortran Unit Test

To test the Fortran code, we'll write a simple program that calls the `foo` subroutine and checks if the array `b` has been correctly manipulated.

```fortran
program test_DRB063_outeronly1_orig_no
    use omp_lib
    implicit none

    call foo()

contains

    subroutine foo()
        integer :: i, j, n, m, len
        real, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: b

        len = 100
        allocate (b(len,len))
        n = len
        m = len
        !$omp parallel do private(j)
        do i = 1, n
            do j = 1, m-1
                b(i,j) = b(i,j+1)
            end do
        end do
        !$omp end parallel do

        ! Check the results
        do i = 1, n
            do j = 1, m-1
                if (b(i,j) /= b(i,j+1)) then
                    print *, "Test failed at: ", i, j
                    stop
                end if
            end do
        end do
        print *, "Test passed."

    end subroutine foo

end program test_DRB063_outeronly1_orig_no
```

### C++ Unit Test

For the C++ code, we'll use a simple test within the `foo` function to verify the array manipulation.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <omp.h>

void foo();

int main() {
    foo();
    return 0;
}

void foo() {
    const int len = 100;
    std::vector<std::vector<float>> b(len, std::vector<float>(len));
    int n = len;
    int m = len;

    // OpenMP parallel loop
    #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(j)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m - 1; ++j) {
            b[i][j] = b[i][j + 1];
        }
    }

    // Check the results
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m - 1; ++j) {
            if (b[i][j] != b[i][j + 1]) {
                std::cout << "Test failed at: " << i << " " << j << std::endl;
                return;
            }
        }
    }
    std::cout << "Test passed." << std::endl;
}
```

### Compilation and Execution

- **Fortran**: Compile the Fortran code with an OpenMP-capable Fortran compiler, e.g., `gfortran -fopenmp test_DRB063_outeronly1_orig_no.f90 -o test_DRB063` and run it with `./test_DRB063`.
- **C++**: Compile the C++ code with an OpenMP-capable C++ compiler, e.g., `g++ -fopenmp test_DRB063_outeronly1_orig_no.cpp -o test_DRB063` and run it with `./test_DRB063`.

These tests will verify that the array manipulation logic in both the Fortran and C++ implementations behaves as expected, ensuring the correctness of the translation.
