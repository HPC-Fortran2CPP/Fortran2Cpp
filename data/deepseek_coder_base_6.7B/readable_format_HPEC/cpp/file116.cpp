To translate the given Fortran code to C++, we need to consider several aspects, including the syntax differences between Fortran and C++, the OpenMP directives, and the way global variables are handled. The Fortran code uses OpenMP for parallel execution and a global variable `i`. In C++, OpenMP can be used similarly, but we'll use a more modern approach to global variables, which is to use them within a class or namespace.

Here's a C++ translation that maintains the original functionality:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

// Define a namespace to mimic the Fortran module 'global'
namespace global {
    // Declare the global variable
    int i = 0;
}

// Forward declaration of the function
void f1(int& i);

int main() {
    // Use the global variable
    int& i = global::i;

    // OpenMP parallel region
    #pragma omp parallel
    {
        // Call the function within the parallel region
        f1(i);
    }

    // Check the value of i
    if (i != 0) {
        std::cout << "i = " << i << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

// Function definition
void f1(int& i) {
    // Increment i within the function
    #pragma omp atomic
    i++;
}
```

Key Points:
- We use a `namespace` named `global` to encapsulate the global variable `i`, similar to how it's encapsulated in a module in Fortran.
- The `f1` function takes a reference to an integer as its argument. This allows the function to modify the original `i` variable, similar to how the Fortran code modifies the global variable.
- The `#pragma omp atomic` directive is used to ensure that the increment of `i` is atomic, which is necessary because `i` is accessed by multiple threads.
- The `#pragma omp parallel` directive is used to parallelize the execution of the `f1` function call.
- The `main` function initializes `i`, calls `f1` within a parallel region, and then checks the value of `i` after the parallel region.
- We use `std::cout` for output, which is the standard way to print to the console in C++.

This C++ code should behave similarly to the original Fortran code, with the added functionality of using OpenMP for parallel execution and a global variable.
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
To verify the correctness of both the original Fortran code and the translated C++ code, we can create simple unit tests. These tests will check if the global variable `i` is correctly incremented by the function `f1`.

### Fortran Unit Test

For the Fortran code, we can write a simple test program that includes the original program as a module and then checks the value of `i` after the parallel execution.

```fortran
module global
    integer :: i = 0
end module global

subroutine f1(i)
    use global
    integer, intent(inout) :: i
    !$omp atomic
    i = i + 1
end subroutine f1

program test_DRB080_func_arg_orig_yes
    use global
    implicit none
    integer :: i

    i = 0

    !$omp parallel
    call f1(i)
    !$omp end parallel

    if (i == 1) then
        print *, 'Test passed: i = ', i
    else
        print *, 'Test failed: i = ', i
    end if
end program test_DRB080_func_arg_orig_yes
```

This Fortran program includes the original functionality and a simple test to verify that `i` is correctly incremented by `f1`.

### C++ Unit Test

For the C++ code, we can use a simple test framework like Google Test. However, for simplicity, I'll show a basic test similar to the Fortran example.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

namespace global {
    int i = 0;
}

void f1(int& i) {
    #pragma omp atomic
    i++;
}

int main() {
    int& i = global::i;

    #pragma omp parallel
    {
        f1(i);
    }

    if (i == 1) {
        std::cout << "Test passed: i = " << i << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Test failed: i = " << i << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This C++ program does the same as the Fortran test: it increments `i` with `f1` and checks if the result is as expected.

### Running the Tests

- **Fortran**: Compile the Fortran test program with an OpenMP-capable Fortran compiler (e.g., `gfortran`) and run the executable. Ensure that the OpenMP flag is enabled (`-fopenmp` for `gfortran`).
  
  ```sh
  gfortran -fopenmp test_DRB080_func_arg_orig_yes.f90 -o test_DRB080
  ./test_DRB080
  ```

- **C++**: Compile the C++ test program with an OpenMP-capable C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`) and run the executable. Ensure that the OpenMP flag is enabled (`-fopenmp` for `g++`).

  ```sh
  g++ -fopenmp test_DRB080_func_arg_orig_yes.cpp -o test_DRB080
  ./test_DRB080
  ```

Both tests should output "Test passed: i = 1" if everything is working correctly. This confirms that the global variable `i` is being correctly incremented by the function `f1` in both the Fortran and C++ versions.
