To translate the given Fortran code to C++, we need to understand the structure and functionality of the original code, including OpenMP directives and array operations. The Fortran code initializes an array `var` of size 16, then performs a parallel reduction operation on `var` using SIMD directives. Finally, it checks if any element of `var` is not equal to 20 and prints those elements.

Here's a C++ version of the code, using OpenMP for parallelism and SIMD directives if supported by the compiler:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
    const int size = 16;
    int var[size] = {0};

    // Initialize var array
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        var[i] = 0;
    }

    // Parallel reduction with SIMD
    #pragma omp target map(tofrom:var) device(0)
    #pragma omp teams distribute parallel for reduction(+:var[:size])
    for (int i = 0; i < 20; ++i) {
        #pragma omp simd
        for (int j = 0; j < size; ++j) {
            var[j] += 1;
        }
    }

    // Check if any element is not equal to 20 and print those elements
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        if (var[i] != 20) {
            std::cout << var[i] << " " << i << std::endl;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Key points in the translation:
- The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive is used to parallelize the loops in C++.
- The `#pragma omp target map(tofrom:var) device(0)` directive specifies that the variable `var` should be mapped to and from the device with index 0.
- The `#pragma omp teams distribute parallel for reduction(+:var[:size])` directive specifies a parallel loop with reduction on `var`. The `[:size]` syntax is used to specify the reduction operation on a specific range of elements.
- The `#pragma omp simd` directive is used to enable SIMD execution for the inner loop.
- The `std::cout` is used for printing in C++.

Please note that the translation assumes that the OpenMP environment is correctly set up in the C++ compiler. Also, the `device(0)` clause might need adjustments based on the specific hardware and OpenMP version, especially if multiple devices are available.
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
Creating unit tests for both the Fortran and C++ versions of the code involves checking the final state of the `var` array after the parallel operations. For simplicity, we'll focus on testing the functionality that involves the parallel reduction and the final state of the `var` array.

### Fortran Unit Test

Fortran doesn't have a built-in unit testing framework like some other languages, but we can write a simple test by modifying the program to check the final state of `var`.

```fortran
program test_DRB163_simdmissinglock1_orig_gpu_no
    use omp_lib
    implicit none
    integer :: var(16), i
    logical :: test_passed

    ! Initialize var
    do i = 1, 16
        var(i) = 0
    end do

    ! Perform parallel reduction
    !$omp target map(tofrom:var) device(0)
    !$omp teams distribute parallel do reduction(+:var)
    do i = 1, 20
        !$omp simd
        do j = 1, 16
            var(j) = var(j) + 1
        end do
        !$omp end simd
    end do
    !$omp end teams distribute parallel do
    !$omp end target

    ! Check the final state of var
    test_passed = .true.
    do i = 1, 16
        if (var(i) /= 20) then
            print*, "Test failed for element:", i, "Value:", var(i)
            test_passed = .false.
        end if
    end do

    if (test_passed) then
        print*, "All tests passed."
    end if

end program test_DRB163_simdmissinglock1_orig_gpu_no
```

### C++ Unit Test

For C++, we can use a simple testing approach similar to the Fortran example. For more comprehensive testing, frameworks like Google Test are recommended.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>
#include <cassert>

int main() {
    const int size = 16;
    int var[size] = {0};
    bool test_passed = true;

    // Initialize var array
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        var[i] = 0;
    }

    // Parallel reduction with SIMD
    #pragma omp target map(tofrom:var) device(0)
    #pragma omp teams distribute parallel for reduction(+:var[:size])
    for (int i = 0; i < 20; ++i) {
        #pragma omp simd
        for (int j = 0; j < size; ++j) {
            var[j] += 1;
        }
    }

    // Check if any element is not equal to 20 and print those elements
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        if (var[i] != 20) {
            std::cout << "Test failed for element: " << i << " Value: " << var[i] << std::endl;
            test_passed = false;
        }
    }

    if (test_passed) {
        std::cout << "All tests passed." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Running the Tests

- **For Fortran**: Compile the Fortran test program with an OpenMP-enabled Fortran compiler (e.g., `gfortran -fopenmp test_DRB163_simdmissinglock1_orig_gpu_no.f90 -o test_DRB163_simdmissinglock1_orig_gpu_no`) and run the executable. Ensure that the OpenMP environment is correctly set up on your system.
- **For C++**: Compile the C++ test program with an OpenMP-enabled C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ -fopenmp test_DRB163_simdmissinglock1_orig_gpu_no.cpp -o test_DRB163_simdmissinglock1_orig_gpu_no`) and run the executable. Ensure that the OpenMP environment is correctly set up on your system.

These tests will verify that the parallel reduction operation on the `var` array in both the Fortran and C++ versions behaves as expected, ensuring that all elements of the array are set to 20 after the operation.
