To translate the given Fortran code to C++, we need to understand the structure and functionality of the original code and then replicate its behavior using C++ syntax and OpenMP directives. The Fortran code uses OpenMP for parallel sections, where each section has its own private copy of the `section_count` variable. The `firstprivate` clause ensures that each thread has its own private copy of `section_count` initialized to 0.

Here's how the Fortran code can be translated to C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
    int section_count = 0;

    omp_set_dynamic(false);
    omp_set_num_threads(1);

    #pragma omp parallel
    {
        #pragma omp sections firstprivate(section_count)
        {
            #pragma omp section
            {
                section_count = section_count + 1;
                std::cout << "section_count = " << section_count << std::endl;
            }

            #pragma omp section
            {
                section_count = section_count + 1;
                std::cout << "section_count = " << section_count << std::endl;
            }
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Key Points in the Translation:

1. **Include OpenMP**: In C++, you include OpenMP by including the `omp.h` header.

2. **Program Structure**: The C++ program structure is straightforward, using `#pragma omp` for OpenMP directives.

3. **Variable Declaration**: The `section_count` variable is declared at the beginning of the `main` function.

4. **OpenMP Settings**: The OpenMP settings are set using `omp_set_dynamic` and `omp_set_num_threads`, similar to the Fortran code.

5. **Parallel and Sections**: The `#pragma omp parallel` and `#pragma omp sections` directives are used to parallelize the sections. The `firstprivate(section_count)` clause ensures that each thread has its own private copy of `section_count`.

6. **Output**: The output is done using `std::cout`, which is the standard C++ way of printing to the console.

7. **Compilation**: To compile this C++ program with OpenMP support, you typically use a command like `g++ -fopenmp your_program.cpp -o your_program`.

This translation preserves the original program's functionality, using OpenMP in a C++ context.
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
Creating unit tests for both the Fortran and C++ versions of the code involves checking that the `section_count` variable is indeed private to each section and that each section increments its own `section_count`. However, it's important to note that the original Fortran code and its C++ translation do not explicitly test this behavior because the original code's primary function is to demonstrate the use of OpenMP's parallel sections feature, which is tested implicitly by observing the output.

To create unit tests that explicitly verify the behavior of the `section_count` variable, we'll slightly modify both the Fortran and C++ codes to include explicit checks. However, please note that the original code's primary function is to demonstrate parallel execution and shared memory access, not to perform unit tests. For unit testing, we'll focus on the parallel execution aspect.

### Fortran Code with Test

To test the Fortran code, we can modify the program to include checks after the parallel sections. However, Fortran doesn't have a built-in unit testing framework like some other languages, so we'll do a simple manual check.

```fortran
program DRB126_firstprivatesections_orig_no
    use omp_lib
    implicit none

    integer :: section_count
    integer :: expected_count

    section_count = 0
    expected_count = 1

    call omp_set_dynamic(.FALSE.)
    call omp_set_num_threads(1)

    !$omp parallel
    !$omp sections firstprivate( section_count )
        !$omp section
        section_count = section_count+1
        if (section_count /= expected_count) then
            print *, "Test failed: section_count should be", expected_count, "but got", section_count
        else
            print *, "Test passed: section_count is correct."
        endif

        !$omp section
        section_count = section_count+1
        if (section_count /= expected_count) then
            print *, "Test failed: section_count should be", expected_count, "but got", section_count
        else
            print *, "Test passed: section_count is correct."
        endif
    !$omp end sections
    !$omp end parallel
end program
```

### C++ Code with Test

For the C++ code, we can use a simple assertion to test the behavior. C++ doesn't have a built-in unit testing framework, but for this example, we'll use assertions. For more comprehensive testing, consider using a testing framework like Google Test.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>
#include <cassert>

int main() {
    int section_count = 0;
    int expected_count = 1;

    omp_set_dynamic(false);
    omp_set_num_threads(1);

    #pragma omp parallel
    {
        #pragma omp sections firstprivate(section_count)
        {
            #pragma omp section
            {
                section_count = section_count + 1;
                assert(section_count == expected_count);
                std::cout << "Test passed: section_count is correct." << std::endl;
            }

            #pragma omp section
            {
                section_count = section_count + 1;
                assert(section_count == expected_count);
                std::cout << "Test passed: section_count is correct." << std::endl;
            }
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Compilation and Execution

- **Fortran**: Use a Fortran compiler like `gfortran`. Compile and run the Fortran code as follows:
  ```sh
  gfortran -fopenmp your_fortran_code.f90 -o fortran_test
  ./fortran_test
  ```

- **C++**: Use a C++ compiler like `g++`. Compile and run the C++ code with assertions enabled. If you're using `g++`, the command would be:
  ```sh
  g++ -fopenmp your_cpp_code.cpp -o cpp_test -DNDEBUG
  ./cpp_test
  ```

These tests are basic and focus on verifying that each section has its own private copy of `section_count`. For more comprehensive testing, especially in larger and more complex programs, consider using a dedicated unit testing framework and more detailed test cases.
