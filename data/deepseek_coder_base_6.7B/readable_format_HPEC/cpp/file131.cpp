To translate the given Fortran code to C++, we need to understand the structure and functionality of the original Fortran code, including the use of OpenMP for parallel processing and dynamic allocation of memory for the `counter` variable. The Fortran code uses a module `DRB088` which is not provided, so we will assume it contains a subroutine `foo` that we need to translate to C++ as well.

Here is a C++ version of the Fortran code, using OpenMP for parallel processing and dynamic memory allocation with `new` and `delete`. Note that C++ does not have a direct equivalent to Fortran's `allocate` and `deallocate`, but we can use `new` and `delete` for dynamic memory allocation.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

// Assuming the functionality of the foo subroutine is to increment the counter by 1.
// Since the original Fortran code does not specify the functionality of foo, we'll define it as a placeholder.
void foo() {
    #pragma omp atomic
    counter += 1;
}

int main() {
    // Dynamic allocation of the counter variable
    int* counter = new int;

    *counter = 0;

    #pragma omp parallel
    {
        #pragma omp single
        foo();
    }

    std::cout << *counter << std::endl;

    // Deallocation of the counter variable
    delete counter;

    return 0;
}
```

Key Points in the Translation:
- We use `#pragma omp parallel` to indicate parallel execution. Inside this block, we use `#pragma omp single` to ensure that only one thread executes the `foo` function. This is because the original Fortran code suggests that `foo` might be intended to be executed in parallel, but it should only be called once to increment the counter.
- We use `#pragma omp atomic` to ensure that the increment of `counter` is atomic, which is necessary because `counter` is accessed by multiple threads.
- Memory allocation for `counter` is done using `new int;` and deallocation is done using `delete counter;`.
- We use `std::cout` for output instead of Fortran's `print*`.
- The `implicit none` statement in Fortran is not needed in C++ as variable types must be explicitly declared.
- The `use omp_lib` and `use DRB088` statements in Fortran are assumed to be importing OpenMP and a module named `DRB088`, respectively. In C++, we include the OpenMP library with `#include <omp.h>` and assume the existence of the `foo` function, which we define as a placeholder.

This translation assumes that the functionality of `foo` in the original Fortran code is to increment the `counter` by 1. If the actual functionality of `foo` is different, you should adjust the `foo` function accordingly.
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
Creating unit tests for both the Fortran and C++ code involves checking that the `counter` is correctly incremented by the `foo` subroutine/function in both cases. However, the original Fortran code does not specify the functionality of `foo`, so for demonstration purposes, let's assume `foo` increments the `counter` by 1.

### Fortran Unit Test

For Fortran, we can write a simple test by modifying the program to include a known value for `counter` before parallel execution and then check the final value of `counter` after execution.

```fortran
program test_DRB088_dynamic_storage_orig_yes
    use omp_lib
    implicit none

    integer :: counter

    allocate(counter)
    counter = 0

    !$omp parallel
    call foo()
    !$omp end parallel

    if (counter == 1) then
        print*, "Test passed: counter is 1"
    else
        print*, "Test failed: counter is not 1"
    end if

    deallocate(counter)

contains

    subroutine foo()
        !$omp atomic
        counter = counter + 1
    end subroutine foo

end program test_DRB088_dynamic_storage_orig_yes
```

This test checks if `counter` is incremented by 1 after parallel execution.

### C++ Unit Test

For C++, we can use a simple test by modifying the main function to include a known value for `counter` before parallel execution and then check the final value of `counter` after execution.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

int* counter;

void foo() {
    #pragma omp atomic
    (*counter) += 1;
}

int main() {
    counter = new int;
    *counter = 0;

    #pragma omp parallel
    {
        #pragma omp single
        foo();
    }

    if (*counter == 1) {
        std::cout << "Test passed: counter is 1" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Test failed: counter is not 1" << std::endl;
    }

    delete counter;

    return 0;
}
```

This test checks if `counter` is incremented by 1 after parallel execution.

### Running the Tests

- **For Fortran:** Compile the Fortran test with an OpenMP-supporting Fortran compiler, e.g., `gfortran -fopenmp test_DRB088_dynamic_storage_orig_yes.f90 -o test_DRB088_dynamic_storage_orig_yes`, and run the executable.
- **For C++:** Compile the C++ test with an OpenMP-supporting C++ compiler, e.g., `g++ -fopenmp test_DRB088_dynamic_storage_orig_yes.cpp -o test_DRB088_dynamic_storage_orig_yes`, and run the executable.

These tests should output "Test passed: counter is 1" if the `counter` is correctly incremented by the `foo` subroutine/function in both the Fortran and C++ versions.
