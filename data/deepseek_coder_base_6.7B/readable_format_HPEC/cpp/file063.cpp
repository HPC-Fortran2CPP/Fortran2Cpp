To translate the given Fortran code to C++, we need to consider several aspects, including array indexing, memory management, and OpenMP directives. Fortran arrays are 1-based, while C++ arrays are 0-based. Also, Fortran's `allocate` and `deallocate` statements are replaced by dynamic memory allocation in C++ using `new` and `delete`. OpenMP directives in Fortran starting with `!$omp` need to be adapted to their C++ equivalents, which are `#pragma omp`. Here's how the translation might look:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
    const int len = 1000;
    int* a = new int[len];

    // Initialize the array
    for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
        a[i] = i + 1; // Adjusting for 0-based indexing
    }

    // OpenMP target directive equivalent in C++
    #pragma omp target map(a)
    {
        // OpenMP parallel for directive equivalent in C++
        #pragma omp parallel for
        for (int i = 0; i < len - 1; ++i) {
            a[i] = a[i + 1] + 1;
        }
    }

    // Print the values
    for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
        std::cout << "Values for i and a(i) are: " << i + 1 << " " << a[i] << std::endl; // Adjusting for 0-based indexing
    }

    delete[] a; // Deallocate the array
    return 0;
}
```

Key points in the translation:

1. **Array Indexing**: Adjusted to start from 0 in C++, as opposed to 1 in Fortran.
2. **Memory Management**: Used `new` and `delete[]` for dynamic array allocation and deallocation, respectively, in C++.
3. **OpenMP Directives**: Replaced Fortran-specific OpenMP directives (starting with `!$omp`) with their C++ equivalents (`#pragma omp`).
4. **Output**: Used `std::cout` for output, which is the standard way to print to the console in C++.

Remember to compile this C++ code with OpenMP support enabled. For example, if you're using GCC, you would compile the program with the `-fopenmp` flag:

```sh
g++ -fopenmp your_program.cpp -o your_program
```
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
Creating unit tests for both the Fortran and C++ versions of the code involves checking the final state of the array `a` after the parallel operation. For simplicity, we'll assume that the parallel operation is correctly implemented if all elements of the array are incremented by 1, except for the last element which should remain unchanged.

### Fortran Unit Test

Fortran doesn't have a built-in unit testing framework like some other languages, but we can write a simple test procedure within the program. This example assumes the use of OpenMP for parallelism.

```fortran
program test_DRB026
    use omp_lib
    implicit none

    integer :: i, len, errors
    integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: a

    len = 1000
    errors = 0

    allocate (a(len))

    ! Initialize the array
    do i = 1, len
        a(i) = i
    end do

    ! OpenMP target directive equivalent in C++
    !$omp target map(a)
        !$omp parallel do
        do i = 1, len-1
            a(i) = a(i+1) + 1
        end do
        !$omp end parallel do
    !$omp end target

    ! Test the results
    do i = 1, len
        if (i < len .and. a(i) /= i + 1) then
            errors = errors + 1
        endif
        if (i == len .and. a(i) /= i) then
            errors = errors + 1
        endif
    end do

    if (errors == 0) then
        print *, "Test Passed."
    else
        print *, "Test Failed with ", errors, " errors."
    endif

    deallocate(a)
end program test_DRB026
```

### C++ Unit Test

For C++, we can use a simple approach similar to the Fortran example, or we can use a unit testing framework like Google Test. Here, I'll provide a simple example without a framework for consistency with the Fortran example.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

bool test_array(int* a, int len) {
    for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
        if (i < len - 1 && a[i] != i + 2) { // Expect a[i] to be incremented by 1
            return false;
        }
        if (i == len - 1 && a[i] != len) { // Last element should remain unchanged
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    const int len = 1000;
    int* a = new int[len];

    // Initialize the array
    for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
        a[i] = i + 1; // Adjusting for 0-based indexing
    }

    // OpenMP target directive equivalent in C++
    #pragma omp target map(a)
    {
        // OpenMP parallel for directive equivalent in C++
        #pragma omp parallel for
        for (int i = 0; i < len - 1; ++i) {
            a[i] = a[i + 1] + 1;
        }
    }

    // Test the results
    if (test_array(a, len)) {
        std::cout << "Test Passed." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Test Failed." << std::endl;
    }

    delete[] a; // Deallocate the array
    return 0;
}
```

### Compilation and Execution

For Fortran, use a command similar to:

```sh
gfortran -fopenmp test_DRB026.f90 -o test_DRB026
./test_DRB026
```

For C++, use a command similar to:

```sh
g++ -fopenmp test_DRB026.cpp -o test_DRB026
./test_DRB026
```

These tests will verify that the parallel operations on the array `a` are correctly implemented in both the Fortran and C++ versions.
