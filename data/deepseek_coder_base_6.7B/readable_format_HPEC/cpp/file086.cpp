To translate the given Fortran code to C++, we need to consider several aspects, including the use of OpenMP for parallelization, the global array `a`, and the initialization of `x`. In C++, we can use OpenMP similarly, and we can use a global array or a vector for `a`. Here's how the translation might look:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <omp.h>

// Assuming the globalArray module provides a way to access the global array 'a'.
// For simplicity, we'll define it as a global vector here.
std::vector<int> a;

// Assuming the useGlobalArray function from the Fortran code is used to initialize or use 'a'.
// Since we don't have the implementation, we'll just declare it for now.
void useGlobalArray(int len);

int main() {
    int len = 100;
    int x = 10;

    // Assuming 'useGlobalArray' initializes or sets up 'a' with size 'len'.
    useGlobalArray(len);

    // OpenMP parallel region
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 1; i <= len; ++i) {
        a[i-1] = x; // Adjusting index for 0-based indexing in C++
        x = i;
    }

    std::cout << "x = " << x << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

// Placeholder for the useGlobalArray function
void useGlobalArray(int len) {
    // Resize the vector 'a' to 'len'
    a.resize(len);
    // Initialize or use 'a' as needed
    // For simplicity, we'll just leave it uninitialized.
}
```

Key Points in the Translation:

1. **Global Array**: In C++, we use a `std::vector<int>` to represent the global array `a`. This choice is for simplicity and dynamic sizing, which is common in Fortran code dealing with global arrays.

2. **OpenMP**: The OpenMP directives (`!$omp parallel do` and `!$omp end parallel do`) are translated to `#pragma omp parallel for` in C++. This tells the compiler to parallelize the loop using OpenMP.

3. **Indexing**: Fortran arrays are 1-based, while C++ arrays (and vectors) are 0-based. This difference is accounted for in the loop by adjusting the indexing accordingly.

4. **Function `useGlobalArray`**: The original Fortran code snippet does not provide the implementation of `useGlobalArray`. In the C++ translation, I've included a placeholder function that you would need to define based on your specific requirements.

5. **Output**: The `write(*,*)` statement in Fortran is replaced with `std::cout` in C++ for output.

Remember to compile the C++ code with OpenMP support enabled. For example, if you're using GCC, you would compile the code with the `-fopenmp` flag:

```sh
g++ -fopenmp your_program.cpp -o your_program
```
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
Creating unit tests for both the Fortran and C++ code involves checking the final state of the global array `a` and the value of `x` after the parallel execution. Since the original code does not include the implementation of `useGlobalArray`, I'll assume it initializes `a` with zeros or some other default value. For simplicity, I'll assume `a` is initialized to zeros in both the Fortran and C++ codes.

### Fortran Unit Test

For Fortran, we can write a simple test program that checks the final state of `a` and `x`. Note that Fortran doesn't have a built-in unit testing framework like some other languages, so we'll do a basic implementation.

```fortran
program testDRB016
    use omp_lib
    use globalArray
    implicit none

    integer :: len, i, x
    logical :: test_passed

    len = 100
    x = 10

    call useGlobalArray(len)

    !$omp parallel do
    do i = 1, len
        a(i) = x
        x = i
    end do
    !$omp end parallel do

    test_passed = .true.
    do i = 1, len
        if (a(i) /= x) then
            test_passed = .false.
            exit
        endif
    end do

    if (test_passed) then
        print *, "Test Passed: a(i) matches x for all i."
    else
        print *, "Test Failed: a(i) does not match x for some i."
    endif

    print *, "x =", x
end program testDRB016
```

### C++ Unit Test

For C++, we can use a simple testing approach similar to the Fortran example. For more comprehensive testing, you might consider using a unit testing framework like Google Test.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <omp.h>
#include <cassert>

std::vector<int> a;

void useGlobalArray(int len) {
    a.resize(len, 0); // Initialize with zeros
}

int main() {
    int len = 100;
    int x = 10;

    useGlobalArray(len);

    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 1; i <= len; ++i) {
        a[i-1] = x;
        x = i;
    }

    bool test_passed = true;
    for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
        if (a[i] != x) {
            test_passed = false;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (test_passed) {
        std::cout << "Test Passed: a[i] matches x for all i." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Test Failed: a[i] does not match x for some i." << std::endl;
    }

    std::cout << "x = " << x << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Compilation and Execution

- **Fortran**: Compile with `gfortran -fopenmp testDRB016.f90 -o testDRB016` and run with `./testDRB016`.
- **C++**: Compile with `g++ -fopenmp testDRB016.cpp -o testDRB016` and run with `./testDRB016`.

These tests check if all elements of `a` are equal to `x` after the parallel execution. If the test passes, it means the parallel execution behaves as expected. Adjust the `useGlobalArray` implementations or the initial values of `a` as needed for your specific use case.
