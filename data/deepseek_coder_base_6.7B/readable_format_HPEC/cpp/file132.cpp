Certainly! Below is the equivalent C++ code for the provided Fortran code. This C++ code uses OpenMP for parallelism, similar to the Fortran code.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
    int x = 2;

    #pragma omp task mergeable
    {
        x = x + 1;
    }

    std::cout << "x = " << x << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Include OpenMP**: The `#include <omp.h>` directive is used to include the OpenMP library.
2. **Main Function**: The main function initializes the variable `x` to 2.
3. **Parallel Task**: The `#pragma omp task mergeable` directive is used to create a task that can be merged with other tasks. The task body increments `x` by 1.
4. **Printing**: The value of `x` is printed to the standard output.

### Compilation:
To compile this C++ code with OpenMP support, you can use a command similar to the following (assuming you have an OpenMP-capable compiler like `g++`):

```sh
g++ -fopenmp -o DRB129_mergeable_taskwait_orig_yes DRB129_mergeable_taskwait_orig_yes.cpp
```

This command enables OpenMP and compiles the code into an executable named `DRB129_mergeable_taskwait_orig_yes`.
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
Below are the unit test codes for both the original Fortran code and the translated C++ code. These tests will verify the correctness of the translation by checking the final value of `x`.

### Fortran Unit Test Code

```fortran
program test_DRB129_mergeable_taskwait_orig_yes
    use omp_lib
    implicit none

    integer :: x
    integer :: expected_x

    x = 2
    expected_x = 3

    !$omp task mergeable
    x = x + 1
    !$omp end task

    ! Check the result
    if (x == expected_x) then
        print *, "Test passed: x = ", x
    else
        print *, "Test failed: x = ", x, " expected: ", expected_x
    end if
end program test_DRB129_mergeable_taskwait_orig_yes
```

### C++ Unit Test Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
    int x = 2;
    int expected_x = 3;

    #pragma omp task mergeable
    {
        x = x + 1;
    }

    // Check the result
    if (x == expected_x) {
        std::cout << "Test passed: x = " << x << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Test failed: x = " << x << " expected: " << expected_x << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Fortran Unit Test Code**:
   - The program initializes `x` to 2.
   - It then creates a task that increments `x` by 1.
   - It checks if the final value of `x` is as expected (3) and prints the result.

2. **C++ Unit Test Code**:
   - The main function initializes `x` to 2.
   - It then creates a task that increments `x` by 1.
   - It checks if the final value of `x` is as expected (3) and prints the result.

### Compilation and Execution:

#### Fortran:
To compile and run the Fortran unit test code, use the following commands (assuming you have an OpenMP-capable Fortran compiler like `gfortran`):

```sh
gfortran -fopenmp -o test_DRB129_mergeable_taskwait_orig_yes test_DRB129_mergeable_taskwait_orig_yes.f90
./test_DRB129_mergeable_taskwait_orig_yes
```

#### C++:
To compile and run the C++ unit test code, use the following commands (assuming you have an OpenMP-capable C++ compiler like `g++`):

```sh
g++ -fopenmp -o test_DRB129_mergeable_taskwait_orig_yes test_DRB129_mergeable_taskwait_orig_yes.cpp
./test_DRB129_mergeable_taskwait_orig_yes
```

These commands will compile and execute the unit tests, verifying the correctness of the translation by checking the final value of `x`.
