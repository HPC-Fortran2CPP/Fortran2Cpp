To translate the given Fortran code to C++, we need to consider several aspects, such as array indexing, data types, and the loop constructs. Fortran arrays are 1-based, while C++ arrays are 0-based. Also, Fortran passes arrays to functions/subroutines by reference automatically, while in C++, we need to explicitly use pointers or references. For simplicity and closer alignment with the original Fortran code, I'll use raw pointers in the C++ translation.

Here's how the Fortran code can be translated to C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Assuming DATA_TYPE is a floating-point type, we'll use double for C++.
// If it's an integer type, you might use int or size_t.
using DATA_TYPE = double;

void init_array(int n, DATA_TYPE& alpha, DATA_TYPE& beta, DATA_TYPE** a, DATA_TYPE** b, DATA_TYPE* x) {
    // Allocate memory for the 2D arrays a and b
    a = new DATA_TYPE*[n];
    b = new DATA_TYPE*[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        a[i] = new DATA_TYPE[n];
        b[i] = new DATA_TYPE[n];
    }

    alpha = 43532.0;
    beta = 12313.0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        x[i] = static_cast<DATA_TYPE>(i) / static_cast<DATA_TYPE>(n);
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            a[j][i] = (static_cast<DATA_TYPE>(i) * static_cast<DATA_TYPE>(j)) / static_cast<DATA_TYPE>(n);
            b[j][i] = (static_cast<DATA_TYPE>(i) * static_cast<DATA_TYPE>(j)) / static_cast<DATA_TYPE>(n);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 10; // Example size
    DATA_TYPE alpha, beta;
    DATA_TYPE** a = nullptr;
    DATA_TYPE** b = nullptr;
    DATA_TYPE* x = new DATA_TYPE[n];

    init_array(n, alpha, beta, a, b, x);

    // Example: Print alpha and beta to verify
    std::cout << "alpha: " << alpha << ", beta: " << beta << std::endl;

    // Clean up
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        delete[] a[i];
        delete[] b[i];
    }
    delete[] a;
    delete[] b;
    delete[] x;

    return 0;
}
```

This C++ code does the following:
1. Defines a function `init_array` that initializes the arrays `a`, `b`, and `x` based on the given logic.
2. Demonstrates dynamic memory allocation for the 2D arrays `a` and `b`.
3. Initializes `alpha` and `beta` with the given values.
4. Fills the arrays `a` and `b` with the computed values, considering the 0-based indexing in C++.
5. Includes a `main` function to demonstrate the usage of `init_array`.
6. Finally, it cleans up the dynamically allocated memory.

Note: This translation assumes `DATA_TYPE` is a floating-point type (`double` in this case), and adjusts the indexing accordingly. If `DATA_TYPE` is an integer type, you might need to adjust the division and multiplication operations to ensure correctness.
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
To verify the correctness of both the original Fortran code and the translated C++ code, we can write unit tests. For Fortran, we'll use a simple approach to test the subroutine, as Fortran doesn't have a built-in unit testing framework like some other languages. For C++, we'll use Google Test, a widely used C++ testing framework.

### Fortran Unit Test

Since Fortran lacks a built-in unit testing framework, we'll write a simple test program that calls the subroutine and checks the results. This is a basic approach and doesn't cover all edge cases or advanced features of a unit testing framework.

```fortran
program test_init_array
    implicit none
    integer, parameter :: n = 10
    double precision, dimension(n, n) :: a, b
    double precision, dimension(n) :: x
    double precision :: alpha, beta
    integer :: i, j
    logical :: test_passed

    call init_array(n, alpha, beta, a, b, x)

    test_passed = .true.
    if (alpha /= 43532.0d0 .or. beta /= 12313.0d0) then
        print *, "Test failed: alpha or beta values are incorrect."
        test_passed = .false.
    endif

    do i = 1, n
        if (x(i) /= (i-1)/n) then
            print *, "Test failed: x(", i, ") is incorrect."
            test_passed = .false.
        endif
        do j = 1, n
            if (a(j, i) /= ((i-1)*(j-1))/n .or. b(j, i) /= ((i-1)*(j-1))/n) then
                print *, "Test failed: a(", j, ",", i, ") or b(", j, ",", i, ") is incorrect."
                test_passed = .false.
            endif
        end do
    end do

    if (test_passed) then
        print *, "All tests passed."
    endif
end program test_init_array
```

### C++ Unit Test with Google Test

First, ensure you have Google Test installed and set up in your project. The following example assumes you have Google Test set up correctly.

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include "init_array.h" // Assume the translated C++ code is in this header file.

TEST(InitArrayTest, CorrectValues) {
    int n = 10;
    double alpha, beta;
    double** a = nullptr;
    double** b = nullptr;
    double* x = new double[n];

    init_array(n, alpha, beta, a, b, x);

    EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(alpha, 43532.0);
    EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(beta, 12313.0);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(x[i], static_cast<double>(i) / static_cast<double>(n));
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(a[j][i], (static_cast<double>(i) * static_cast<double>(j)) / static_cast<double>(n));
            EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ(b[j][i], (static_cast<double>(i) * static_cast<double>(j)) / static_cast<double>(n));
        }
    }

    // Clean up
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        delete[] a[i];
        delete[] b[i];
    }
    delete[] a;
    delete[] b;
    delete[] x;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
    return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This C++ unit test checks that the `init_array` function correctly initializes `alpha`, `beta`, `x`, `a`, and `b` arrays with the expected values. It uses `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ` to compare floating-point numbers, which is appropriate for double precision.

To run the C++ unit test, compile the test file with Google Test libraries linked, and then execute the resulting binary. The exact compilation command depends on your setup, but it might look something like this:

```sh
g++ -std=
