// Note: The `extern "C"` block is used here to indicate C linkage, which ensures that the symbols (e.g., function names) are not mangled and thus can be easily called from C code. This is particularly useful for interoperability between C and C++. If the Fortran code was meant to interface directly with C++, the `extern "C"` might not be necessary unless ensuring compatibility with C is a requirement.
