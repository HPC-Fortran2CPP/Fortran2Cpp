// Base class for polymorphism
class A {
public:
    virtual ~A() = default; // Virtual destructor for proper cleanup
    // Additional members and functions can be declared here
};

// Derived class example
class Derived : public A {
    // Implementation of derived class
};

// Define the 't' structure with a polymorphic member 'a'
class t {
public:
    std::shared_ptr<A> a; // Polymorphic, dynamically allocated member
    // Constructor, destructor, and other members as needed
};

int main() {
    t x; // Declare an instance of 't'
    t y; // Another instance

    // Example of assigning a derived class object to the polymorphic member
    x.a = std::make_shared<Derived>();

    y = x; // Copy assignment. This works because std::shared_ptr can be copied, sharing ownership of the object.

    // Note: The actual copying behavior of 'a' (shallow vs. deep copy) depends on what you need.
    // The above example does a shallow copy via std::shared_ptr.
