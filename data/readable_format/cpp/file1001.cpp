void s1() {
    // Since 'implicit none' is used in Fortran, all variables should be explicitly declared.
    // However, there are no variables or actions defined in this subroutine,
    // so this is an empty function in C++.
}

void s2() {
    // Similar to s1, 'implicit none(type)' ensures explicit declaration,
    // but there are no actions or variables declared here, so it's also an empty function.
