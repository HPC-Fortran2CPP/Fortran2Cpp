    // Equivalent C++ code for the Fortran subroutine setprob
    // C++ doesn't have a direct equivalent of Fortran's implicit typing,
    // so variables need to be explicitly typed. We'll assume that any
    // variables that would have been affected by the implicit rule in Fortran
    // are appropriately declared as double in the C++ code that uses this function.
    
    std::string fname; // Equivalent to character*12 fname
    // In C++, std::string is more flexible than a fixed-size character array. 
    // If you need exactly 12 characters (not including the null terminator),
    // you could use char fname[13]; instead, but std::string is generally safer and more convenient.
    
    // The Fortran code does not perform any action inside the subroutine,
    // so the C++ translation is also empty in terms of operational code.
    
    // No return statement is needed for void functions in C++.
}

// Note: The Fortran subroutine does not perform any actions, and the implicit typing rule
// does not have a direct equivalent in C++. In Fortran, the implicit statement automatically
// types variables that are not explicitly declared, based on their names. In C++, you must
// declare the type of every variable explicitly, so the concept doesn't directly translate.
