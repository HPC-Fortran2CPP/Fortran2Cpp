    ! Additional tests would follow a similar pattern, creating and checking files as needed.
    ! However, due to the nature of the original program (largely revolving around file existence
    ! and specific content expectations), creating meaningful unit tests would require
    ! manipulating the file system and carefully controlling the environment.
