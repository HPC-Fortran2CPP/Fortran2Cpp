program test_implicit_input_output
    ! This is a mock-up example showing how you might structure tests.
    ! Actual implementation might require writing output to a file and comparing it manually.
    write(*,*) 'Run the program: main.f90'
    write(*,*) 'Expected output:'
    write(*,*) '11.0 12.0 13.0 21.0 22.0 23.0'
    write(*,*) '11.0 12.0 13.0'
    write(*,*) '11.0 21.0'
    write(*,*) 'Actual output:'
    ! Here you would manually compare the output of main.f90 to the expected output.
