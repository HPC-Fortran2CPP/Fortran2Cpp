The code you posted is not parallelized because it does not contain any OpenMP directives.  If you want to parallelize the code, you need to add OpenMP directives.  If you are asking about the output of the code, then you need to show the output.\n\nComment: I have added the output of the code.\n\nComment: The output you show is the Fortran code.  What you need to show is the output of the program.  You can do that by running the program and showing the output.

 DRB115_forsimd_orig_yes\n\n\end{code}\n\nComment: I'm not sure what you're asking.  You're asking why the compiler doesn't optimize the loop into a single instruction?  Or you're asking why the compiler doesn't optimize the loop into a single instruction, and you're asking for a way to force the compiler to do so?\n\nComment: @NateEldredge I'm asking why the compiler doesn't optimize the loop into a single instruction.\n\nComment: @NateEldredge I've added the code to the question.\n\nComment: I'm not sure why the compiler doesn't optimize the loop.  It's not a very complex loop, and the compiler is able to prove that the loop is safe to vectorize.  I'm not sure what the "yes" in the name of the function means.  Do you have any documentation for this function?\n\nComment: @NateEldredge I've added the code to the question. The "yes" in the name of the function means that the compiler is able to vectorize the loop.\n\nComment: I'm not sure what the point of the `omp simd` directive is.  It doesn't seem to do anything.  I think the compiler is already vectorizing the loop.  If you want to force the compiler to vectorize the loop, you can use the `-ftree-vectorize` option.\n\nComment: @NateEldredge I've added the code to the question.\n\nComment: I'm not sure what you're trying to do.  You're asking about the behavior of a specific compiler, but you haven't told us what compiler you're using.  You've also shown us a lot of code that doesn't seem to be relevant to the question.  I think you need to edit your question to make it more clear what you're asking.\n\nComment: @NateEldredge I've added the code to the question.\n\nComment: I'm still not sure what you're asking.  You've shown us a lot of code, but you haven't told us what you're trying to do.  Are you trying to get the compiler to vectorize

It is not a variable that can be changed in the parallel region.\n\nComment: I am trying to use the firstprivate clause to make sure that the value of section_count is the same in each thread.  I am not sure if this is the correct way to do this.\n\nComment: I think you are misunderstanding the purpose of `firstprivate`. It is used to make sure that a variable has the same value in each thread. It is not used to make sure that a variable is the same in each thread.\n\nComment: I see.

I tried the code and it works. I have a few questions. 1. What is the purpose of the `DATA_TYPE` and `DATA_PRINTF_MODIFIER` macros? 2. Why do we need to use `std::endl` instead of `\n` in the `print_array` function?\n\nComment: @user1993 1. `DATA_TYPE` and `DATA_PRINTF_MODIFIER` are used to make the code more generic. They can be changed to `double` or `float` or `int` or whatever type you want to use. 2. `std::endl` is used to flush the output buffer. It is not necessary in this case, but it is a good practice to use it.\n\nComment: Thanks for the explanation. I have one more question. Why do we need to use `std::cout` instead of `printf` in the `print_array` function?\n\nComment: @user1993 Because `printf` is a C function and it is not available in C++. `std::cout` is a C++ function and it is available in C++.\n\nComment: Thanks for the explanation.

Or are you asking why the code doesn't work in C++ with OpenMP?  Or something else?\n\nComment: I'm asking why the code doesn't work in C++ with OpenMP.\n\nComment: The code works fine in C++ with OpenMP.  It's just that the output is not what you expect.  The reason for that is that you're using the wrong format specifier.  You should use `%s` instead of `%10s`.\n\nComment: @JohnZwinck I'm not sure what you mean by "wrong format specifier".  I'm using the same format specifier as in the Fortran code.  The Fortran code works fine.  The C++ code doesn't work.  I'm asking why.\n\nComment: The Fortran code is wrong.
