To translate the given Fortran code to C++, we need to consider several differences between the two languages, such as variable declaration, function definition, and string handling. Here's a C++ version of the Fortran code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cstdlib> // For exit()

// Function prototype
std::string solve(int N);

int main() {
    std::string result;

    result = solve(1000);
    if (result != "1") {
        std::cerr << "Assertion failed for solve(1000)" << std::endl;
        exit(1);
    }

    result = solve(150);
    if (result != "110") {
        std::cerr << "Assertion failed for solve(150)" << std::endl;
        exit(1);
    }

    result = solve(147);
    if (result != "1100") {
        std::cerr << "Assertion failed for solve(147)" << std::endl;
        exit(1);
    }

    result = solve(333);
    if (result != "1001") {
        std::cerr << "Assertion failed for solve(333)" << std::endl;
        exit(1);
    }

    result = solve(963);
    if (result != "10010") {
        std::cerr << "Assertion failed for solve(963)" << std::endl;
        exit(1);
    }

    std::cout << "All tests passed." << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

std::string solve(int N) {
    std::string str = std::to_string(N); // Convert integer N to string
    int sum = 0;

    // Calculate the sum of digits
    for (char c : str) {
        sum += c - '0'; // Subtract '0' to get the digit value
    }

    std::string bi = "";

    // Convert sum to binary
    while (sum > 0) {
        bi = static_cast<char>(sum % 2) + bi; // Append digit to the beginning
        sum /= 2;
    }

    // Handle the case when sum is 0
    if (bi.empty()) {
        bi = "0";
    }

    return bi;
}
```

Key Points in the Translation:

1. **Function Definition**: The `solve` function is defined with the return type `std::string` to handle the string output.
2. **String Handling**: C++'s `std::string` class is used for string operations, which simplifies operations like concatenation and conversion compared to Fortran's character handling.
3. **Variable Declaration**: Variables are declared with their types, using `std::string` for strings and `int` for integers.
4. **Looping Through Strings**: The Fortran code uses a loop to iterate over each character in a string. In C++, we can use a range-based for loop to achieve the same effect.
5. **Character Conversion**: The Fortran code manually converts characters to integers and back. In C++, we use the `- '0'` trick to convert characters to their digit values, and `static_cast<char>()` to convert integer values back to characters.
6. **Program Termination**: The `exit(1)` call is used to terminate the program with an error code, similar to Fortran's `call exit(1)`.

This C++ code should behave similarly to the original Fortran code, performing the same calculations and checks.
Let's write some test to verify if the translation is correct. 
Below are examples of how you could write unit tests for both the Fortran and C++ versions of the code. These tests will verify the correctness of the `solve` function with various inputs.

### Fortran Unit Tests

For the Fortran code, we'll use a simple approach to test the `solve` function by calling it with known inputs and comparing the results against expected outputs. Fortran doesn't have a built-in unit testing framework like some other languages, so we'll do this in a straightforward manner.

```fortran
program test_solve
    implicit none
    character(len=10) :: result
    integer :: errors

    errors = 0

    ! Test 1
    result = solve(1000)
    if (trim(result) /= "1") then
        write(*,*) "Test 1 failed: Expected 1, got ", trim(result)
        errors = errors + 1
    end if

    ! Test 2
    result = solve(150)
    if (trim(result) /= "110") then
        write(*,*) "Test 2 failed: Expected 110, got ", trim(result)
        errors = errors + 1
    end if

    ! Add more tests as needed...

    if (errors == 0) then
        write(*,*) "All tests passed."
    else
        write(*,*) errors, " tests failed."
    end if
end program test_solve

! Include or link the solve function here
```

### C++ Unit Tests

For C++, we can use the Google Test framework for unit testing, which provides a rich set of assertions and is widely used. First, you'll need to set up Google Test in your project. Instructions for setting up Google Test can be found in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/googletest).

Here's how you might write the tests in C++:

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include "solve.h" // Assume the solve function is declared in solve.h

TEST(SolveTest, HandlesZeroInput) {
    EXPECT_EQ(solve(0), "0");
}

TEST(SolveTest, HandlesOneInput) {
    EXPECT_EQ(solve(1), "1");
}

TEST(SolveTest, HandlesMultipleDigitsInput) {
    EXPECT_EQ(solve(100), "1100100");
    EXPECT_EQ(solve(150), "110");
    EXPECT_EQ(solve(147), "1100");
    EXPECT_EQ(solve(333), "1001");
    EXPECT_EQ(solve(963), "10010");
}

// Add more tests as needed...

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
    return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

This C++ code uses Google Test to define three test cases:

1. **HandlesZeroInput**: Tests the `solve` function with an input of `0`, expecting the output to be `"0"`.
2. **HandlesOneInput**: Tests the `solve` function with an input of `1`, expecting the output to be `"1"`.
3. **HandlesMultipleDigitsInput**: Tests the `solve` function with various inputs (100, 150, 147, 333, 963), comparing the outputs against expected binary strings.

To run these tests, you'll need to compile the test file along with the Google Test library and your `solve` function implementation, then execute the resulting binary. The specifics of compiling and running will depend on your development environment and how you've set up Google Test.

These tests should help ensure that the `solve` function behaves correctly across both the Fortran and C++ implementations.
