# F2C-Translator

## Introduction
Fortran has been a widely used programming language for scientific computation since 1957. With technological advancements, modern languages like C++ have become preferable for some projects due to their greater flexibility and features. However, the lack of an accurate and comprehensive Fortran-to-C++ translation dataset means that existing large models, including GPT-4, often struggle to perform this task effectively, resulting in translations that may fail to compile or pass unit tests. F2C-Translator aims to address this issue.

## Model
The Model is avaliable on Huggingface: [F2C-Translator](https://huggingface.co/Bin12345/F2C-Translator)

**NOTE:** We are still training the model. We will continue to update the F2C-Translator.
